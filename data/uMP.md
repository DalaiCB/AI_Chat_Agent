Advanced Energy's Artesyn uMP series GEN II power supply is a configurable power supply with market-leading density and efficiency. It features a very wide 85 to 264 VAC input voltage range and employs active power factor correction to minimize input harmonic current distortion and to ensure compliance with the international EN61000-3-2 standard – they have a power factor of 0.99 typical. The power supplies also feature active AC inrush control to automatically limit inrush current at turn-on to 40 A maximum.
