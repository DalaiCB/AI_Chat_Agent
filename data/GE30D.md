Protection
    * Overvoltage Protection:
        * V1: 115 to 155% of nominal, latch mode, requires AC recycle to reset.
        * V2: 115% to 155% of nominal, USB has a “Cut-out switch” latch protection, requires AC recycle to reset.
    * Overload Protection:
        * V1: 110 to 150% of rating, constant current, then hiccup mode, auto-recovery
        * V2: 130 to 180% of rating, constant current, recovery
    * Short Circuit Protection
        * V1: Hiccup mode, auto-recovery.
        * V2: Constant current, auto-recovery.
        * If the second output is short circuited or overloaded, the first output will continue to operate normally.
        * If the first output is short circuited or overloaded, it is not required that the second  output continues to operate normally.
