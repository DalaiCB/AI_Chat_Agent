Advanced Energy’s Artesyn LCM1000 provides a low cost solution to Industrial and Medical single output high power requirements. Full featured, the 2.4" x 5.2" x 10.0" (footprint) enclosed form factor utilizes smart fans for self contained thermal management at very low acoustic noise levels. Digital Signal Processor control allows for a high level of modification flexibility. Voltage output for the series ranges from 10.8V - 52.8V at a continuous output power of 1000W. The LCM1000 also provides an optional 5V standby, conformal coating, and constant current operation.
