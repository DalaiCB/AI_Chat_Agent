Advanced Energy’s Artesyn LCM1500 series provide for a very wide range of AC-DC embedded power requirement. Featuring high build quality with robust screw terminals, long life, and typical full-load efficiency of greater than 89 percent, these units are ideal for use in industrial and medical applications. They are backed by a comprehensive set of industrial and medical safety approvals and certificates. Variable-speed ‘Smart Fans’ draw on software controls developed by Advanced Energy to match fan speed to the unit’s cooling requirement and load current. Slowing the fan not only saves power but also reduces wear, thus extending its life.
