# TREK 610E

High voltage power supply/amplifier/controller that provides six modes of high-voltage operation.

The Trek® 610E provides six modes of high voltage operation. As a high voltage amplifier, the Trek 610E amplifies an externally applied signal with a switch-selectable setting of 100 V/V or 1000 V/V. As a high voltage reference supply, a front panel dial commands the output voltage. As a transconductance amplifier, an externally applied voltage signal produces a proportional output current. As a current supply, a front-panel dial commands the output currents. As a high voltage controller, the high voltage amplifier mode is maintained but the amplifier input and feedback elements are uncommitted and configured by the user.
