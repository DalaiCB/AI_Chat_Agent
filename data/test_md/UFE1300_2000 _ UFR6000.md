# ARTESYN UFE / UFR SERIES

Up to 6000 Watts

Advanced Energy's Artesyn UFE series of bulk front end AC-DC DATA SHEET power supplies comprises one single output 24 V model and six single output 48 V models. The 24 V model accepts a wide range 90–264 Vac input and is rated at 1,300 watts. The 48 V models are available with a choice of 90-264 Vac input and 1,300 watt output ratings, or 180-264 Vac input and 2000 watt output. All models also provide an 11 V standby output. The main output is floating as well as isolated, allowing positive or negative polarity operation. Standard features include built-in ORing devices and active current sharing. Less than 1U high, UFE series power supplies are ideal for telecommunications, data communications, and industrial applications.

Notes:

1. Final EMI performance is system/shelf dependent.

2. Auto ranging sets power limit based on input voltage at turn on.

3. The difference in output current among any two rectifiers operating in parallel does not exceed a value equal to 15% of the rated current limit. This specification applies for operation with any output current from no load to 110% of maximum.

4. Maximum 15 minute warm up time at light loads below -15 °C. See Application Note 212 for cold start timing data.

5. For operation above 1,524 m (5,000 ft), maximum operation temperature is derated by 2 °C per 305 m (1,000 ft).

6. Output voltage can be modified on the fly between 42-57V (48V model) PMBus command.

7. Unit and rack are conformal coated.
