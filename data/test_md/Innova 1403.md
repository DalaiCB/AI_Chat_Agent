INNOVA 1403

LUMASENSE Muleipoint Sampler and Doser - INNOVA 1405

Reliable and easy-to-use multipoint sampler and doser

The Innova® 1403 Multipoint Sampler and Doser is designed to be remote-controlled from a PC using a USB interface with an Innova 1512 or 1412i Photoacoustic Gas Monitor to provide a flexible, sensitive, and accurate monitoring system. The 1403 greatly increases the area monitoring capabilities of the gas monitor by drawing air samples through tubing from up to six sampling points, up to 50 m away, and delivering the samples to the gas monitor.

PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS

- Automatic calculation of the amount of tracer-gas delivered, to the dosing location
- Factory calibrated dosing system
- Self-test function
- Pneumatic system constructed of AISI-316 Stainless Steel and PTFE tubing to minimize gas absorption

TYPICAL APPLICATIONS

- Air sampling in six locations and delivery to an Innova 1512 or a 1412i Photoacoustic Gas Monitor
- Delivery of tracer gas to up to three locations for ventilation and air-exchange analysis with the Innova 1512 or the 1412i Photoacoustic Gas Monitor

# OVERVIEW

Comprehensive air exchange analysis and ventilation efficiency checks are easily performed using the 1403’s dosing facilities. Tracer gas is delivered through tubing to “label” the air. The amount of tracer gas delivered is automatically calculated by the 1403. The labeled air is then sampled by the 1403 and delivered to the Gas Monitor for analysis.

The 1403 factory calibration and self-checking routines allow for easy verification of the unit’s operation and ensure reliable functioning.

The Innova 1403’s pneumatic system is shown in Figure 1. The sampler system is constructed of AISI-316 stainless steel and poly tetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tubing to minimize absorption of samples. The system has six inlet channels, each with a solenoid valve. Each inlet channel has a tube-mounting stub on the 1403’s front plate. Six tubes of up to 50 m connect each channel to the respective sampling point. The six inlet channels converge into one; a three-way valve then directs the gas sample to the 1512 or the 1412i for analysis or through the pump to the waste-air outlet on the 1403’s backplate. A pressure transducer checks the efficiency of the sampling pump and allows checks for blocked airways. It is recommended that an air filter is attached to the end of each sampling tube to keep the samples free of particles.

Reliability is ensured by automatic self-tests using both hardware and software. A check of the pneumatic system can be performed on request by the controlling computer. The 1403’s operating status is reported to the User Software and any error or warning will be given in a status window on the PC.

# SYSTEM DETAILS

The Doser System

The doser system has three outlet channels, each with a solenoid valve. Up to three channels can be selected at a time depending on the given dosing task. The flow through the outlet channel is determined by the Mass Flow Controller (MFC) and is controlled by the User Software. Calibration data for SF6 and Freon 134a is stored in the User Software.

The dosed amount is determined by the MFC setting. The dosing-gas inlet is pressurized by the tracer gas supply cylinder, which is connected by tubing to the inlet on the 1403’s backplate.

Ventilation Measurements

Ventilation measurements are controlled by both hardware and software in the Innova 1403 Multipoint Sampler and Doser and the Innova 1512 or 1412i Gas Monitor. The user sets up the sampler and the doser unit by selecting up to six sample channels and one out of three doser channels.

Dosing Types

Dosing can be either of type pulsed injection for decay measurements or of type constant dose for flow measurements. Measurement is run automatically and the results are presented in numerical and graphical curve views.

Carrier-Air Inlet

The carrier-air inlet pumps extra air to the dosing outlets to speed delivery of the tracer gas to the dosing point. This inlet has a coarse air filter, a pump, and a pressure transducer for checking the efficiency of the pump.

Calibrating the Doser System

The 1403 is factory calibrated for SF6 and Freon 134a. By selecting the correct gas, the amount of tracer gas delivered during a dosing procedure can be accurately determined by the Mass Flow Controller in the 1403.

Control of the 1403

The 1403 is fully remote-controlled from a PC using the 7650 Basic Ventilation Software or the 7651 Advanced Ventilation Software. Commands and information requests are sent over the interface to the 1403 to control the sampler system, set up and control the dosing system, and read-out data.

7650 Basic Ventilation Software

The Innova 7650 Basic Ventilation Software allows full coordination and control of all the dosing/sampling and monitoring functions of such systems. The 7650 can control one 1512 or 1412i and a 1403 unit.

7651 Advanced Ventilation Software

The optional 7651 Advanced Ventilation Software adds the possibility to use the Constant Concentration Method and up to three dosing valves when using the Decay or the Constant Concentration Method.

System Use

The 1403 combined with the 1512 or the 1412i and a controlling computer with 7650 or 7651 Application Software offers wide-ranging monitoring capabilities. The doser/sampler systems of the 1403 are used for air exchange analysis and multi-point monitoring tasks in various situations and environments.
