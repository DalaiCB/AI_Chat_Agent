Notes:

1. Efficiency, Typical at 115/230Vac, 25°C. See Charts below for load conditions.

2. Measured at 25OC using 6 inch twisted pair wires with noise probe directly across output terminals, and load terminated with 0.1uF ceramic and 10uF low ESR capacitors.

3. Replace “K” in model number with “C” for class II input versions.

4. Consult factory for following models, available may vary.
