# TREK PZD350A M/S

High voltage piezo driver/power amplifier system provides precise voltage control and delivers twice the current of the standard PZD350A.

The Trek® PZD350A M/S piezo driver/amplifier system provides precise voltage control and delivers twice the current of our standard PZD350A. This high-voltage DC-powered amplifier offers voltages that can will be factory set to customer-specified ranges. It features an all-solid state design, impressive slew rates and superior bandwidth capabilities. Other features include a four-quadrant active output stage that sinks or sources current into reactive or resistive loads throughout the output voltage range, precision voltage and current monitors, remote access and dynamic adjustment. The input is configured is inverting but an inverting amplifier configuration is available.
