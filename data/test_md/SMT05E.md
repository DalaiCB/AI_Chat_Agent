# ARTESYN SMT05E SERIES

Non-Isolated DC-DC Converters

| | |DATA SHEET| |
|---|---|---|---|
| | |Total Power:|8.25 Watts|
| | |Input Voltage:|3.0 - 5.5 Vdc|
| | |# of Outputs:|Single|

Advanced Energy's Artesyn SMT05E series of non-isolated DC-DC converters comprises two models, both of which accept a 3 to 5.5 Vdc input. One model produces a fixed 1.5 Vdc output, the other produces an output that can be trimmed over a very wide 0.75 to 3.63 Vdc range to satisfy a broad diversity of semiconductor power needs. Both converters can deliver up to 5 amps output current; the 1.5 V output model is rated at 8.25 watts and has a typical efficiency of 87.5%, while the trimmable output model is rated at 18.15 watts and has a typical efficiency of 94%.

# OUTPUT VOLTAGE ADJUSTMENT

The ultra-wide output voltage trim range offers major advantages to users who select the SMT05E-05W3V3J. It is no longer necessary to purchase a variety of modules in order to cover different output voltages. The output voltage can be trimmed in a range of 0.75 to 3.63 Vdc.

When the SMT05E-05W3V3J converter leaves the factory, the output has been adjusted to the default voltage of 0.75 V.

- When Vin >4.5 V, then Vout can be adjusted from 0.75 - 3.63 Vdc
- When Vin <4.5 V, then Vout can be adjusted from 0.75 - 2.75 Vdc

Notes:

1. The SMT05E features a ‘Negative Logic’ Remote ON/OFF operation. If not using the Remote ON/OFF pin, leave the pin open (the converter will be on). The Remote ON/OFF pin is referenced to ground. The following conditions apply for the SMT05E:

|Configuration|Converter Operation|
|---|---|
|Remote pin open circuit|Unit is ON|
|Remote pin pulled low|Unit is ON|
|Remote pin pulled high [Von/off > 2.5 V]|Unit is OFF|

A ‘Positive Logic’ Remote ON/OFF version is also possible with this converter. To order please use part number SMT05E-05W3V3-RJ or SMT05E-05W3V3-RTJ.

Full derating curves available in both the Longform (Technical Reference) and Application Note.
NOTICE: Some models do not support all options. Please contact your local Artesyn Embedded Power representative or use the on-line model number search tool at http://www.artesyn.com to find a suitable alternative.
