TREK 344

Precision electrostatic voltmeter for non-contacting surface voltage measurements in the range of 0 to ±2 kV DC or peak AC.

The Trek® 344 employs a field-nulling technique for non-contacting voltage measurement that achieves DC stability and high accuracy even if the probe-to-surface spacing changes. This permits measurements of either stationary or moving surfaces without the need to establish fixed spacing to maintain accuracy.

The Trek 344 patented probe design eliminates the need for close tolerance components. This significantly improves noise and drift performance, both in the presence of contaminating particulates and under conditions of high humidity and wide temperature ranges.

A precision voltage monitor provides a low-voltage replica of the measured electrostatic potential for monitoring purposes, or for use as a feedback signal in a closed-loop system.

PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS

- Superb noise and drift performance
- Variety of probes available for different installation requirements
- Precision voltage monitor output
- Easy-to-read LED display
- Operated on a bench top or with optional hardware, a standard 19 in rack. The rack adapter allows two Trek 344 units to mount together
- Digital enable feature provides a connection for a remote device to turn on and off the high voltage of the instrument. This makes the 344 suitable for automated or computer-controlled systems
- NIST-traceable Certificate of Calibration provided with each unit
