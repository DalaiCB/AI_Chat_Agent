Notes:

1. 5 V output is adjustable with +/-10% range. Other output voltages available, consult factory.
2. Total regulation is defined as the maximum deviation from the nominal voltage for all steady state conditions of initial voltage setting, input line voltage, and output load.
3. Measured with noise probe directly across output terminals, and load terminated with 0.1 μF ceramic and 47 μF low ESR capacitors. Ripple & Noise of V2 at no load is 2% maximum.
4. All specifications are typical at 230 Vac, full load, at 25°C ambient unless noted.
5. Contact factory for availability of specific models.

For models with optional cover/chassis, add "-C" suffix to above model numbers. Output power derates to 104 W with airflow, 75 W convection cooled.
