# MIKRON M315X-HT

Two-piece, high temperature blackbody calibration source with a large surface area. Ambient 30 to 600°C (86 to 1112°F).

The Mikron® M315X-HT blackbody sources are resistively heated by precision heating elements to provide uniform temperature distributions. The two-piece system is comprised of controller module and a separate enclosure for the emitter source with available aperture sizes from 4" x 4" (101 mm x 101 mm) up to 12" x 12" (305 mm x 305 mm). Emitter source temperature control is carried out by a precision digital PID controller, mounted in a 7” (180 mm) high enclosure. An exceptionally stable RTD ensures long-term temperature stability of the system.

# MIKRON M315X-HT

# OVERVIEW

Blackbody calibration sources are infrared radiators used for calibrating and verifying the output signals of infrared thermometers (pyrometers), thermal imaging systems, heat flux measurement systems, or spectrographic analysis systems. Advanced Energy supplies a unique selection of very precise calibration sources that are traceable to national standards. Quotations for custom designs and variations are available upon request.

The M315X-HT blackbody calibration sources are designed to satisfy the exacting parameters of infrared focal plane array detectors, thermal imaging, and FLIR systems testing in projection scene and field applications where higher temperatures are required.

These calibration sources combine high emissivity along with unchallenged stability and uniformity. Mikron calibration sources have long been the gold standard to calibrate the instruments that keep your operations up and running. These blackbodies are superior because of the emissivity values, homogeneous emission areas, and a wide range of different sized apertures to adapt to the desired target area. In addition, fast heat-up times and high temperature stability are guaranteed. The quality of our calibration sources is guaranteed by tests, burn-in times, and radiometric calibrations. On most models, a certificate is provided to document the traceability to the international temperature scale ITS90 and NIST.
