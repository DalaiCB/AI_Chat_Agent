# OVERVIEW

The Trek® 5/80-HS is a DC-stable, high-speed, high-voltage power amplifier used in industrial and research applications. It features an all-solid-state design for high slew rate, wide bandwidth, and low-noise operation. The four-quadrant, active output stage sinks or sources current into reactive or resistive loads throughout the output voltage range. This type of output is essential to achieve an accurate output response and high slew rate demanded by a variety of loads such as highly capacitive or reactive loads. It is configured as a non-inverting amplifier.

Features:

- High-Voltage On/Off: Local, individual push-button switch
- Remote: TTL compatible input. TTL high (or open) turns off high-voltage output. TTL low turns on high-voltage output
- Dynamic Adjustment: Graduated one-turn panel potentiometer is used to optimize the AC response for various load parameters
- Limit/Trip Mode: Switch selectable for either limit or trip. Graduated one-turn potentiometer is used to adjust limit or trip level from 0 to 100% peak current. There is one LED indicator and one BNC connector
- Trip Status Indicator/Connector: Illuminates and a TTL low is provided after the amplifier is out of regulation for more than 500 ms. The HV output is not disabled
- Limit Status Indicator/Connector: Illuminates and a TTL low is provided after the amplifier is out of regulation for more than 500 ms. The HV output is not disabled
- Out of Regulation Status: Illuminates and a TTL low is provided when the unit fails to produce required HV output such as during a current limit

Measured using the true rms feature of the HP Model 34401A digital multimeter
