# IMPAC IGAR 6 SMART

Stationary, digital ratio pyrometer with possible combination of 1-color and 2-color non-contact temperature measurement in ranges between 100 and 2550°C (212 to 4622°F).

The Impac® IGAR 6 Smart is a digital, compact and fast infrared thermometer that can be operated in different modes: 1-color mode, 2-color mode or a special Smart mode. In Smart mode, measurements at lower temperatures are taken in 1-color mode whereas at higher temperatures the measurements are based on the 2-color method (ratio method). In this mode, the user can set the temperature at which the instrument transitions from 1-color mode to 2-color mode (min. transition temperature: 250°C, min. transition range: 30°C).

# IMPAC IGAR 6 SMART

# OVERVIEW

In 2-color mode, two adjacent wavelengths are used for the temperature determination. This technique offers the following advantages compared to standard 1-color pyrometers:

- The temperature measurement is largely independent of the object’s emissivity and in wide ranges unaffected by dust and other contaminants in the field of view.
- The measuring object can be smaller than the spot size, measurements through dirty viewing windows are possible up to a certain contamination.

The response time of only 2 ms facilitates the measurement of fast processes. The IGAR 6 is also equipped with a built-in “dirty window” warning.

|100°C|1-color mode| |
|---|---|---|
|250°C|1-color measurement| |
|2,550°C|2-color mode| |
|SMART MODE| | |

When the instrument is operated in Smart mode, measurements at lower temperatures are taken in 1-color mode whereas at higher temperatures the measurements are based on the 2-color method (ratio method). The temperature at which the instrument transitions from 1-color mode to 2-color mode is flexible and can be set by the user (min. transition temperature: 250°C, min. transition range: 30°C).

When the instrument is operated in 2-color or smart mode, InfraWin provides the option to automatically determine the emissivity. By pushing the button “Emi=xxx% Accept”, this emissivity is set and used for all measurements in 1-color mode or in smart mode below the selected transition temperature.

# IMPAC IGAR 6 SMART

# INFRAWIN 5 OVERVIEW

InfraWin is easy-to-use measurement and evaluation software for remote configuration of stationary, digital Impac brand pyrometers.

This software allows the user to remotely adjust and control settings for one or two pyrometers from a single computer. InfraWin also allows the user to simultaneously monitor and control temperatures.

- Display temperature data as color bars and online graphics
- Capture downstream evaluations as tables, graphics or text files
- Calculate the spot size for different measuring distances
- Features UPP standard (Universal Pyrometer Protocol)

# Pyrometer Settings

An Impac digital pyrometer connected to a PC will be automatically detected by the software. All available parameters are adjustable, including emissivity, response time, maximum value storage, output signal, and sub-range.

Further special functions are adjustable, for example, controllers or TV parameters on instruments available with these functions. Changes are transmitted directly to the pyrometer.

# Measurement with Color Bar

In this window, a temperature value for the upper or lower limit can be adjusted numerically or with the mouse. The acquired minimum and maximum value is indicated as well as the inner temperature of the pyrometer. The emissivity is changeable during the measurement at any time.

# Spot Size Calculator

After input of the aperture and the focused spot size per datasheet, the calculation of spot sizes at non-focused distances is possible.

Measurement with Internal Temperature of radiation temperature and internal instrument temperature. Parameters can be changed during the measurement.

I/O Module allows users to trigger measurement externally and gives a potential free output contact.
