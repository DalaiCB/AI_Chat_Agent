# IMPAC IPE 140 Optics

The pyrometers are available with different focusable optics. They offer the smallest possible spot size at any distance. The adjustment can be done easily without additional tools with help of the "turn and clamp" mechanism (one hand). The spot sizes are shown in the following table (all distances are measured from the front of the lens). The different optics are exchangeable without recalibration of the pyrometer. For spot sizes between those in the table, values can be found by interpolation.

ADVANTAGES OF DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING

The signal processing of series 140 pyrometers is fully digital, i.e. the detector signal is digitized immediately and digitally processed. With this technique, an extremely high accuracy and repeatability as well as very long measuring ranges are achieved.

Accuracy

The high accuracy is achieved by the digital linearization of the sensor output as well as the digital compensation of the ambient temperature.

Temperature Range

Due to the digital technique, the user can set any temperature sub range within the full temperature range. The minimum span of the sub range is 51°C. The analog measuring output automatically corresponds to the selected sub range. This setting of a sub range can be done without recalibration of the pyrometer and does not affect the high accuracy and repeatability. As almost any sub range is adjustable, the storage of spare instruments or the replacement of other pyrometers is simplified.

Output

The analog measuring outputs 0 to 20 mA or 4 to 20 mA are selectable as well as the serial digital interfaces RS232 or RS485. The interface also allows the pyrometer to be controlled via the PC.

Bus Control

The serial interface RS485 facilitates the integration of the pyrometer into existing field bus systems

Calibration

If a suitable calibration source is available, a calibration of the pyrometers can be done via serial interface without opening the housing.

# INFRAWIN 5 OVERVIEW

InfraWin is easy-to-use measurement and evaluation software for remote configuration of stationary, digital Impac brand pyrometers.

This software allows the user to remotely adjust and control settings for one or two pyrometers from a single computer. InfraWin also allows the user to simultaneously monitor and control temperatures.

- Display temperature data as color bars and online graphics
- Capture downstream evaluations as tables, graphics or text files
- Calculate the spot size for different measuring distances
- Features UPP standard (Universal Pyrometer Protocol)

# Pyrometer Settings

An Impac digital pyrometer connected to a PC will be automatically detected by the software. All available parameters are adjustable, including emissivity, response time, maximum value storage, output signal, and sub-range.

Further special functions are adjustable, for example, controllers or TV parameters on instruments available with these functions. Changes are transmitted directly to the pyrometer.

# Measurement with Color Bar

In this window, a temperature value for the upper or lower limit can be adjusted numerically or with the mouse. The acquired minimum and maximum value is indicated as well as the inner temperature of the pyrometer. The emissivity is changeable during the measurement at any time.

# Infrared Calculator

After input of the aperture and the focused spot size per datasheet, the calculation of spot sizes at non-focused distances is possible.

|O"C7|82.9PC|
|---|---|
|104.7*C|110.0PC|

I/O Module allows users to trigger measurement externally and gives a potential free output contact.
