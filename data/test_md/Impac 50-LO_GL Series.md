# IMPAC IS 50-LO/GL

Digital pyrometer with fiber optics designed for non-contact temperature measurement in glass applications in ranges between 600°C and 1800°C (1112 to 3272°F).

The Impac® IS 50-LO/GL is a non-contact infrared thermometer with a fiber optic cable designed for the glass industry. It is primarily used for temperature measurement of glass in tank, working end, forehearth, and feeder applications. Additional applications include the temperature measurement of brickworks in the regenerator and tank. The IS 50-LO/GL uses the two-wire technique that combines the high accuracy of the digital signal processing with the simple connection and operating with two wires.
