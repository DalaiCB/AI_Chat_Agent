The Mikron® M316 two-piece portable blackbody calibration source is an ideal unit for field calibration or verification of infrared temperature sensors. The calibration source is contained within a compact, hand-held housing weighing only 2 pounds. A flexible cable connects to the 1.5 pound indicating controller, which can be carried via the handle. The small size of the calibration source allows the operator to easily position it to read the sensor—even in hard to reach locations. Consequently, there is no need to remove the sensor from its position.

OVERVIEW

Blackbody calibration sources are infrared radiators used for calibrating and verifying the output signals of infrared thermometers (pyrometers), thermal imaging systems, heat flux measurement systems, or spectrographic analysis systems. Advanced Energy supplies a unique selection of very precise calibration sources that are traceable to national standards. Quotations for custom designs and variations are available upon request.

are superior because of the emissivity values, homogeneous emission areas, and a wide range of different sized apertures to adapt to the desired target area. In addition, fast heat-up times and high temperature stability are guaranteed. The quality of our calibration sources is guaranteed by tests, burn-in times, and radiometric calibrations. On most models, a certificate is provided to document the traceability to the international temperature scale ITS90 and NIST.

Mikron calibration sources have long been the gold standard to calibrate the instruments that keep your operations up and running. These blackbodies
