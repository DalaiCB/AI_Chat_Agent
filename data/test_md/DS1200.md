# ARTESYN DS1200

1200 Watts

Distributed Power System

Advanced Energy's Artesyn DS1200 series is Artesyn Embedded Power's highest power, highest density bulk front end AC-DC power supply in the industry standard 1U x 2U form factor. It accepts a wide range 90 to 264 VAC input and provides a main 12 V output plus a 3.3 V or optional 5.5 V standby output. Rated at 1,100 watts, it has a high half-load efficiency of 91%. Housed in an industry standard 1U x 2U rack-mounting package, the power supply is designed for servers and similar space-constrained applications. This series comes in two airflow versions – dc-connector to ac-connector and vice versa.

# LOGIC CONTROL

|PS_SEATED (A4)|TTL logic LOW if power supply is seated into system connector. This is a short pin. A logic HIGH if the PSU is removed.|
|---|---|
|PWR GOOD (C3)|Active TTL high when output is within regulation limits.|
|AC OK (B1)|A low logic level if the input voltage is within allowable limits. A TTL logic HIGH level, and a 5mS early warning signal before 12.0 VDC output loss of regulation.|
|PS_INHIBIT/PS_KILL (B4)|When left open power supply operation will be inhibited. When the power supply is inserted into the system, this pin will be pull low by the system and turn the power supply on only after all other power supply pins have seated.|
|PS ON (A1)|The output will be enabled when this signal is pulled low, below 0.8 V outputs disabled when pin is driven high or left open.|
