MONROE 272A

Rapid, accurate, and repeatable measurements of surface resistivity, volume resistivity, or resistance to ground in one versatile instrument.

The Monroe 272A measures the resistive properties of static control products such as static dissipative packaging, flooring, or work surfaces over the range of 8 x 10^3 to 2 x 10^13 ohms or 8 x 10^4 to 2 x 10^14 ohms per square. Simply place the resistive material under the instrument’s electrode assembly. One glance at the large digital display will tell you whether the test material meets your specifications.

MONROE PORTABLE SURFACE RESISTIVITY / RESISTANCE METER 272A

EASY-TO-USE OPERATION

To measure resistivity (Ω/□), a sample is placed under the electrode assembly and a voltage is applied to the outer of two concentric electrodes resting on the sample. The geometry of the electrode assembly’s surface is such that current flows from the outer ring, via the sample, to the inner electrode is a direct indication of the sample’s resistivity, which is read on the digital display. In the resistance-measuring mode, current flows from ground or a second electrode through the resistive material to the measurement electrode. All test parameters can be preset, so operation is push-button simple. The instrument can be programmed to automatically time out to save battery.

Easy-To-Use Test parameters (resistivity/resistance, test voltage, display mode) only need to be set once before testing multiple samples. To perform either resistivity or resistance to ground measurements:

1. Place the test material on the supplied TefIon® coated specimen support plate and connect a single test lead to the plate.
2. Set the electrode assembly on the test material.
3. Press POWER ON and read test results on the display.
