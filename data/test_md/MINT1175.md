4 A, 250 VAC fuses provided in both line & neutral

2kV (CM) and 1kV (DM) surge

Provided - no damage will occur if the output is shorted.

Hiccup mode

Latching type, recycle AC input to reset. OVP firing reduces output voltage to &lt;50% of nominal in &lt;50 mS. See "Ordering Information" for trip ranges.

Automatic power shutdown at TC = 155°C

Stays HIGH during normal operation. Signal will go LOW with at least 5 mS warning before loss of DC output from AC failure.

Open collector logic signal goes and stays HIGH, 100mS to 500mS after main output reaches regulation.

AC Power Failure/DC OK signal - J600:During normal operation stays HIGH - goes HIGH, 100-500 mS after main output.- goes LOW, with 5 mS warning before loss of output from AC failure.

AC Power failure and DC OK Signals use the same pin, so the signals can be as follows:DC OK: Pin 2 = High & Pin 1 = HighAC Power Failure: Pin 2 = Low & Pin 1 = Low

AC Inhibit Signals - J600:Disable: Connect to output Common or pull down this pin below 10VEnable: Floating or High (10.5V - 12.6V)
