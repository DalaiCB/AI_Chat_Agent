TREK 370

Non-contacting electrostatic voltmeter provides precise surface voltage measurements in the range of 0 to ±3 kVDC or peak AC.

The Trek® 370 precision electrostatic voltmeter for non-contacting surface voltage measurements in the range of 0 to ±3 kV DC or peak AC. The Trek 370 employs an electrostatic field-nulling technique which achieves high DC stability and high measurement accuracy even if the probe to measured surface spacing changes. This permits measurements of either stationary or moving surfaces without the need to establish fixed spacing to maintain accuracy.

# AT A GLANCE

|Very High Speed Response|Less than 50 ms for a 1 kV step|
|---|---|
|Measurement Range|0 to ±3 kVDC or peak AC|
|Measurement Accuracy|Better than ±0.05% of full scale|

# PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS

- Automatic gain control eliminates manual adjustment when changing probes or changing the probe to measured surface separation
- One step, push-button zeroing automatically adjusts the output to zero volts when the probe is coupled to a known zero volt surface
- Precision voltage monitor provides a low-voltage replica of the measured electrostatic voltage for external monitoring purposes, or for use as a feedback signal in a closed-loop system
- Digital enable allows an external device to turn the internal HV power supply on/off
- Operated on a bench top, or with optional hardware, in a standard 19-inch rack
- NIST-traceable Certificate of Calibration provided with each unit

# TECHNICAL DATA

Features:

- Zero Control: A momentary push-button switch to produce zero volts output when the probe is coupled to a known zero volt surface.
- Automatic Gain Control: The Trek 370 automatically optimizes the gain of the AC response when changing the type of probe being used or when changing the probe-to-surface separation.
- Digital Enable: An open collector, TTL compatible input to enable or disable the measurement. A TTL high will disable the measurement, while a TTL low will enable the measurement.
- Voltage Display: Four-character, Seven-segment LED display.

|Range|0 to ±3000 V|
|---|---|
|Resolution|1 V|
|Zero Offset|±1 count, referred to the voltage monitor|
|Sampling Rate|2.5 readings per second|
