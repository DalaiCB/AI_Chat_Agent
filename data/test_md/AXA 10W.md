# ARTESYN AXA SERIES

10 Watts

Advanced Energy's Artesyn AXA series of high-input isolated DC-DC converters that feature an ultra wide 4:1 input voltage range of 18–75 Vdc or 9-36Vdc respectively and are primarily designed for use with nominal 48V or 24V supplies. There is a choice of five single output models, offering single voltage versions of 3.3 V, 5 V, 12 V, 15 V or 24 V and dual output versions of +/-5V, +/-12V and +/-15V. The converters are fully encapsulated in a compact 1 x 1 inch (25.4 x 25.4 mm) metal case incorporating an isolated baseplate and have a height of just 0.4 inch (10.2 mm). An optional clip-on heatsink is available for convection cooling. Standard features include 1,500 Vdc input/output isolation, remote On/Off and hiccup mode short-circuit protection.
