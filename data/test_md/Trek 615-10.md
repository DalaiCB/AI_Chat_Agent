# TREK 615-10

High voltage AC/DC generator and amplifier system used in a broad range of research and development and production applications.

The Trek® 615-10 is a precision high voltage AC/DC generator and amplifier system used in a broad range of R&D and production applications. In the constant voltage mode, the Trek 615-10 generates constant amplitude waveforms with or without DC bias. In the constant current mode, it generates constant amplitude AC current waveforms, with or without DC bias and in amplifier mode, an analog voltage input connector is provided to apply external AC or DC signals. The Trek 615-10 provides many extra features, along with exclusive instrument control and an interface to be used in remote operation.
