# XSTREAM REMOTE PLASMA SOURCE WITH ACTIVE MATCHING NETWORK

FULLY INTEGRATED PLASMA SOURCE PLATFORM FOR HIGH-FLOW AND HIGH-PRESSURE, REACTIVE-GAS PROCESSES

The high-efficiency Xstream® platform, mounted outside the process chamber, generates neutral, reactive species from stable feed gases for the purposes of surface modification, chamber cleaning, thin-film etch, and plasma-assisted deposition. The Xstream platform integrates a remote plasma source, a 8 kW or 10 kW high-efficiency power supply, and a patented, solid-state active matching network™ that accommodates the widest impedance operating range commercially available in a chamber clean source. The Xstream platform gives process engineers unsurpassed flexibility in their reactive-gas processes, thus improving system throughput and optimizing the use of expensive resources.

# XSTREAM® REMOTE PLASMA SOURCE WITH ACTIVE MATCHING NETWORK™

WIDEST IMPEDANCE OPERATING RANGE COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE

The integration of a remote plasma source, a power supply, and a solid-state active matching network enables the Xstream platform to operate in an expanded impedance range that’s nearly one-and-one-half times that of other remote plasma sources.

OPERATES WITH A BROAD RANGE OF CHEMISTRIES

Incorporating previously patented AE technology, the solid-state active matching network allows seamless operation with a broad range of chemistries, including:

| |Ar|N2|O2|NF3|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|CF4|H2O|N2O|C3F8|CF62|
|CF84|C4FO8|CHF3| | |

NF3 DISSOCIATION PERFORMANCE

THEORY OF OPERATION

The Xstream remote plasma source uses mid-frequency RF power to generate a plasma that dissociates feed gases within a toroidally shaped, ferrite-coupled inductive plasma chamber. Because the plasma is isolated from the process chamber and wafer, only neutral, reactive species are emitted, thus reducing wear on the tool process kit, extending the time between expensive maintenance cycles and eliminating the possibility of charge damage to sensitive wafer structures. The Xstream platform uses a fully integrated, active matching network to optimize delivered power. The patented, solid-state active matching network, which incorporates patented AE technology, accommodates the widest impedance operating range commercially available.

INCREASES PROCESS FLEXIBILITY AND THROUGHPUT

A single Xstream unit can, for example, run reactive-gas deposition with N2 or O2, then run a post-process chamber clean with a variety of fluorine chemistries—something previously impossible in a single, high-capacity chamber plasma source.

EASY TO RETROFIT FOR IN-SITU AND REMOTE CHAMBER CLEANS

The compact Xstream unit is especially well suited as a retrofit unit for chamber configurations with older microwave or toroidal RF plasma sources. The retrofit return on investment (ROI) is compelling: the Xstream platform can significantly reduce the downtime associated with RPS repairs and maintenance, as well as improve ignition reliability and process performance.

AE’s flexible mounting options and tool retrofit kits streamline on-chamber installation.
