# IMPAC KTG 218 AND KTS 218

Fast infrared temperature switches for non-contact recognition of hot objects located in the field of view between 400 and 1500°C.

The Impac® KTS 218 and KTG 218 recognizes hot objects located with non-contact monitoring, to trigger a switch process. The switching level can be adjusted via potentiometer and the switch status is indicated by LED.
