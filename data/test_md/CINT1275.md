# Timing Sequence

The outputs of N+1 (N=1,2…5) models can be shared. It is shown in below, one load-share controller is required for each model and circuits are identical when N+ 1 identical models are used.

Terminals J302 and J303 are connected to the Vo+ and Vo-, respectively, of the first power model. The Vo+ and Vo- correspond to the other models positive and negative output pins. The Vo+ connects to positive output bus to the load and Vo connects the negative output bus to the load.

The J201 pin1 and pin3 connects to the S+ and S-, respectively, of the first power models. The S+ and S- correspond to the other models J201 pin1 and pin3. The S+ connects to positive output bus and S- connects to negative output bus.
