TREK 609B-3

High voltage power amplifier for industrial and research applications that features an all solid-state design for a high slew rate, wide bandwidth, and low-noise operation.

TREK

The Trek® 609B-3 is a DC-stable high voltage power amplifier. The four-quadrant, active output stage sinks or sources current into reactive or resistive loads throughout the output voltage range. This output is essential to achieve an accurate output response and high slew rate demanded by highly capacitive or reactive loads. It is configured as a non-inverting amplifier, an inverting amplifier, or as a differential amplifier. Different input configurations can be wired into the unit.

PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS
Four-quadrant output for driving capacitive loads
Closed loop system for high accuracy
Short-circuit protected for equipment protection
DC-stable for programmable supply applications
Low output noise for ultra-accurate outputs
NIST-traceable Certificate of Calibration provided wip each unit
