MONROE 257D

Portable, battery-operated fieldmeter for performing static surveys or for use as a diagnostic tool when troubleshooting problems caused by static build-up.

The Monroe 257D is a portable, battery-operated fieldmeter for performing static surveys or for use as a diagnostic tool when troubleshooting problems caused by static buildup.

The instrument offers a chopper-stabilized measurement technique that is drift free, even in ionized environments. An AC adaptor is provided to recharge the batteries and to operate the Monroe 257D during longer-term tests.
