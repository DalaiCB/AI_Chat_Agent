# TREK 605A

High voltage reference supply designed to provide precise control of output voltages featuring an all-solid-state design for accurate, low-noise operation.

The Trek® 605A is a high voltage reference supply designed to provide precise control of output voltages in the range of 0 to +1 kVDC or 0 to -1 kVDC with an output current range of 0 to ±1 mADC. The Trek 605A provides two modes of operation: a fixed mode providing a constant +1 kV or -1 kV output, and a variable mode providing variable control of the output voltage with a one (1) volt resolution over a range of 0 to ±1 kV.

The Trek 605A features an all-solid-state design for accurate, low-noise operation and is protected against over-current conditions that may be generated by output short circuits to ground. A digital enable feature provides a connection for a remote device to turn on and off the high voltage of the instrument. This makes the instrument suitable for automated or computer-controlled systems. The Trek 605A is designed to be operated on a bench top.

# PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS

- Line and load regulation better than 0.002%
- Automatic current limit feature to protect the instrument from output short circuits or overloads
- Remote high voltage on/off feature ideal for use with automated or computer-controlled systems

Toggle switch to select either fixed or variable output voltage.

Select either +1 kV or -1 kV using the polarity switch when the mode switch is in the fixed position.

Calibrated 10-turn dial.

Three-position toggle switch. In the center position the output terminals are disconnected from the high voltage supply and a 10 kW, 2 W resistor is placed across the output terminals.

A rear panel BNC providing a connection for remotely turning on and off the high voltage output of the Trek 605A.

A switch, a relay, or the output of a switching device, such as an open collector transistor, connected between the center conductor and shield of the BNC. The high voltage will be turned off when this connection is open. The high voltage will be turned on when this connection is closed.

1.2 mA. An indicator will illuminate when the instrument is in a current limit condition.

1 Measured using the true rms feature of the HP Model 34401A digital multimeter
