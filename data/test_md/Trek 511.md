TREK 511

High-quality, portable, chopper-stabilized, non-contacting electrostatic field meter designed for measuring and auditing electrostatic fields in ESD sensitive areas.

The Trek® 511 portable, non-contacting electrostatic field meter is designed for measuring and auditing electrostatic fields in ESD sensitive areas so that operators can find them before they become a problem. Features of the Trek 511 such as its LED indicator with a switch selectable measurement range of either ±2 kV or ±20 kV, add to instrument flexibility and benefit the operator through its ease of use. Operators also benefit from the ability to obtain or audit reliable and accurate ESD measurements in either ionized or non-ionized environments.
