# Notes:

OCP can not be adjusted on the fly. Default setting is for 250 W Forced Air.

Unit should be turned off before trimpot adjustment.

OCP does not vary linearly with the trimpot adjustment. It is either Full clockwise (250 W) or Full counter clockwise (155 W).

Thermal Hot Spot Reference - Do not exceed indicated temperature limits to ensure operation is within the component thermal derating limits. Measure the component temperatures using K type thermocouples.

Recommended Mounting Screw - M3.0 (4X) Pan head screw with teeth washer, 6 mm length, 6~8 Kgf-cm Torque.

Unit weight 200 g max
