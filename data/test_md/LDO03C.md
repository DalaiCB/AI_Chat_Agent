# OUTPUT VOLTAGE ADJUSTMENT OF THE LDO03C SERIES

The ultra-wide output voltage trim range offers major advantages to users who select the LDO03C series. It is no longer necessary to purchase a variety of modules in order to cover different output voltages. The output voltage can be trimmed in a range of 0.59 - 5.1 Vdc. When the LDO03C converter leaves the factory, the output has been adjusted to the default voltage of 0.59 V.

Notes:

1. Measured as per recommended system capacitance. See Technical Reference Note.

2. di/dt = 10 A/μs, Vin = Nom, Tc = 25 °C, load change = 0.50 lo to full lo and full lo to 0.50.

3. External input fusing is recommended.

4. Additional part numbers may be available with different output voltages.

5. Airflow dependent, 100 LFM minimum required.

6. No capacitors needed for ripple current stability.

7. No capacitors needed for stability.

8. TSE RoHS 5/6 (non Pb-free) compliant versions may be available on special request, please consult your local sales representative for details.

9. NOTICE: Some models do not support all options. Please contact your local Artesyn Embedded Power representative or use the on-line model number search tool at http://www.artesyn.com to find a suitable alternative.
