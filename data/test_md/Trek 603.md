TREK 603

High voltage power amplifier/piezo driver for precise control of output voltages in customer specified bipolar or unipolar ranges within available ranges.

The Trek® 603 is a high-voltage DC power amplifier/piezo driver designed to provide precise control of output voltages in bipolar or unipolar ranges that are customer specified within a range of available settings. The instrument achieves the accurate output responses and high slew rates demanded by reactive loads by utilizing a four-quadrant active output stage that sinks or sources current into reactive or resistive loads. The Trek 603 is configured as a non-inverting amplifier and is available in single or dual channel packaging that are operable on a bench top or in a 19 in rack.
