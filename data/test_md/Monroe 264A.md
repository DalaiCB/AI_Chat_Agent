MONROE 264A

Portable survey instrument for evaluating resistive properties of static control products such as static dissipative packaging, flooring, or work surfaces.

The Monroe 264A is a portable, battery-operated survey instrument for evaluating the resistive properties of static control products such as static dissipative packaging, flooring, or work surfaces over the range of 10^5 to 10^12 ohms or ohms per square. Model 264A uses a parallel electrode configuration conforming to ASTM D-257. A test lead is included for resistance-to-ground measurements. Place the 264A directly on the item to be measured and the easy-to-read LED decade display quickly and clearly indicates the resistivity or resistance range.

# EASY-TO-USE OPERATION

Combining pocket-size convenience, affordability, and ASTM sensing techniques, the Monroe 264A is just what you need to spot defective static control devices and materials in your production areas. Resistivity is measured by placing the Monroe 264A's parallel electrode rails completely in contact with the material under test. The geometry of the electrode assembly is such that the current flow from one rail, across the material, to the other rail is a direct indication of the material's resistivity, which is read on the LED display. In the resistance-measuring mode, current flow from ground through the resistive material to the measurement electrode.

To measure resistivity:

1. Place the test material on a flat, non-conductive surface
2. Position the Monroe 264A so that both rails rest completely on the sample
3. Press the TEST button and read the sample's resistivity on the LED display

To measure resistance-to-ground, connect the furnished ground lead to the instrument's GND jack and follow steps 2 and 3.
