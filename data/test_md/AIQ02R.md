The AIQ02R series high voltage quarter-brick DC-DC converters accept a wide range 250 to 420 Vdc input and are designed for use with power factor correction (PFC) modules. Rated at 65 watts, the AIQ02R series can deliver full continuous power at operating baseplate temperatures from -40 to 100˚C. The converters have a typical efficiency of 90% and produce a 28 Vdc output that can deliver up to 2.32 amps; the output voltage can be adjusted from 25.2 to 29.4 V with an external trim resistor.
