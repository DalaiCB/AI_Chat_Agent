# ARTESYN SMT15E SERIES Non-Isolated DC-DC Converter

Advanced Energy's Artesyn SMT15E_12V series non-isolated DC-DC converter accepts a 10 to 14 Vdc input and produces an output that can be trimmed over a very wide 0.8 to 3.63 Vdc range to satisfy a broad diversity of semiconductor power needs. Rated at 49.5 watts, the converter has a typical efficiency of 94% and can deliver up to 15 amps. Standard features include remote On/Off, remote sense, and comprehensive protection against short-circuit and overtemperature conditions. Packaged as a low profile surface-mount module, it has a 0.53 x 1.3 inch (13.5 x 33 mm) footprint and an installed height of only 0.32 inch (8.2 mm).

# OUTPUT VOLTAGE ADJUSTMENT

The ultra-wide output voltage trim range offers major advantages to users who select the SMT15E-12W3V3J. It is no longer necessary to purchase a variety of modules in order to cover different output voltages. The output voltage can be trimmed in a range of 0.8 Vdc to 3.63 Vdc. When the SMT15E-12W3V3J converter leaves the factory the output has been adjusted to the default voltage of 0.8 V.

Notes:

1. The SMT15E features a ‘Positive Logic’ Remote ON/OFF operation. If not using the Remote ON/OFF pin, leave the pin open (the converter will be on). The Remote ON/OFF pin is referenced to ground. The following conditions apply for the SMT15E:

|Configuration|Converter Operation|
|---|---|
|Remote pin open circuit|Unit is ON|
|Remote pin pulled low [Von/off < 0.8 V]|Unit is OFF|
|Remote pin pulled high [Von/off >1.6 V]|Unit is ON|
2. Full derating curves available in both the Longform Datasheet and Application Note.
3. Typical efficiency figures for various output voltages are as follows:
|Output Voltage|Efficiency|
|---|---|
|1.2 V|83%|
|1.5 V|85.5%|
|1.8 V|87.5%|
|2.0 V|91%|
|2.5 V|92%|
4. NOTICE: Some models do not support all options. Please contact your local Artesyn representative or use the on-line model number search tool at http://www.artesyn.com to find a suitable alternative.
