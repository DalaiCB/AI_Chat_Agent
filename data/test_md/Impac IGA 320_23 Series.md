# OPTICS

Depending on the selected type the pyrometers are equipped ex works with optics 250 or 800 mm. At these distances the optics are focused, i.e. where they achieve the smallest spot size in relation to the measuring distance. At any other distances (shorter or longer) the spot size will change, normally it will increase. With the optional close-up lens, the distances can be decreased and smaller spot sizes achieved. Please note that the measuring object must be at least as big as the spot size.

The following table shows the size of the spots (M in mm) at a given measuring distance a [mm]. Values between the stated data can be calculated by interpolation. The aperture D indicates the diameter of the optics (at measuring distance 0), this value is used to calculate measuring distances in intermediate distances, e.g. with the spot size calculator in the InfraWin software.

INFRAWIN 5 OVERVIEW

InfraWin is easy-to-use measurement and evaluation software for remote configuration of stationary, digital Impac brand pyrometers.

This software allows the user to remotely adjust and control settings for one or two pyrometers from a single computer. InfraWin also allows the user to simultaneously monitor and control temperatures.

- Display temperature data as color bars and online graphics
- Capture downstream evaluations as tables, graphics, or text files
- Calculate the spot size for different measuring distances
- Features UPP standard (Universal Pyrometer Protocol)

Pyrometer Settings

An Impac digital pyrometer connected to a PC will be automatically detected by the software. All available parameters are adjustable, including emissivity, response time, maximum value storage, output signal, and sub-range.

Further special functions are adjustable, for example, controllers or TV parameters on instruments available with these functions. Changes are transmitted directly to the pyrometer.

Measurement with Color Bar

In this window, a temperature value for the upper or lower limit can be adjusted numerically or with the mouse. The acquired minimum and maximum value is indicated as well as the inner temperature of the pyrometer. The emissivity is changeable during the measurement at any time.

Infrared Calculator

After input of the aperture and the focused spot size per datasheet, the calculation of spot sizes at non-focused distances is possible.

Measurement with Internal Temperature

Measurement with Internal Temperature of radiation temperature and internal instrument temperature. Parameters can be changed during the measurement.

I/O Module

I/O Module allows users to trigger measurement externally and gives a potential free output contact.
