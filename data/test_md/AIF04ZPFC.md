# ARTESYN AIF - PFC

SERIES

1600 Watts

Advanced Energy's Artesyn AIF04ZPFC series full-brick power factor correction module accepts a wide 85 to 264 VAC input and presents a unity power factor. It can also be configured to accept a DC input within the range 120 to 370 VDC. Rated at 1,600 watts, the module has a high conversion efficiency of 95% and provides a nominal non-isolated output voltage of 380 Vdc. Featuring an industry-standard 2.4 x 4.6 full-brick form factor and a height of only 0.5 inch, they have a power density of 290 watts per cubic inch.
