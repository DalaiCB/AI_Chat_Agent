LPX6X: 5.9 (150) x 3.86 (98) x 1.97 (38)

Base plate has three sets of customer mountings:

a. Bottom mounting (4X) M3 inserts. Max. screw penetration 0.0787 (2mm)

b. Side mounting (2X) 4mm clear holes plus 2 keyways. (See keyway detail)

c. Side mounting (4X) M3 inserts. Max. screw penetration 0.236 (6mm)

Ensure insulator is correctly fitted in the base under PCB to maintain safety creepage and clearances.

Ensure the base is firmly connected to supply earth via the earth stud marked.

When using this enclosure, ensure that relevant safety standards (e.g. EN60950) are complied with, in respect to creepage and clearance distances, and distances through insulation.
