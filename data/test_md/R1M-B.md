The Model R1M-B Handheld Voltmeter/Megohmmeter complies with MILT-T-28800, Type III, Class 3, Style E for rugged operational environments and shipboard applications. These units perform under the extremes of heat, cold, humidity, shock, vibration, and operator abuse.

The R1M-B is designed to measure insulation resistance in “live” circuits, which may have voltage present. The R1M-B may be connected to 600 V RMS AC or DC without damage, and its mode of operation is automatic. It has no fuse to replace. The R1M-B will operate after a drop from a height of four feet to a concrete floor.

# Operation

The R1M-B Voltmeter/Megohmmeter is activated by pressing the “TEST” switch. When the R1M-B is first turned on, its input is automatically selected as a voltage input, reading any voltage present on the test leads, and displaying that voltage on a liquid crystal display. At the same time, the “VOLTS” LED lights.

If the voltage sensed on the test leads exceeds approximately 1 V, the R1M-B will not take any additional readings. However, if there is no voltage (or less than approximately 1 V) on the test leads, the instrument will automatically switch to the megohmmeter mode, whereupon the internal 500 V supply is connected to the test leads and the measured resistance is displayed.

As long as the “TEST” switch is depressed, the R1M-B will continue to take readings. Releasing the switch will automatically turn off the unit, to maximize battery life and minimize the risk of the operator being shocked by the 500 V across the test probes during resistance measurements. (Note that the test current is limited to approximately 1 mA, but this can still produce a shock.)
