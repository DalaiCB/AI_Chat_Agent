# OVERVIEW

The pyrometer parameters can be selected via keys. Two adjustable limit switches can be used to trigger a switch process, e.g. to recognize hot objects located in the measuring beam.

The settings are indicated on the built-in LED display. In measuring mode, the actual temperature is indicated.

The pyrometers are equipped with RS232 and RS485 serial interfaces (switchable via the keys). This enables the reading of temperature and pyrometer parameters via the provided InfraWin PC-software. If necessary, the parameters also can be changed via PC. A thru-lens view finder or laser targeting light for exact alignment of the pyrometer are available.

# ADVANTAGES OF DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING

The signal processing of Series 12 pyrometers is fully digital, i.e. the detector signal is digitized immediately and digitally processed. With this technique, extremely high accuracy, high repeatability, and very long measuring ranges are achieved.

# Accuracy

The high accuracy will be achieved by the digital linearization of the sensor output as well as the digital compensation of the ambient temperature.

# Temperature Range

Due to the digital technique the user can set any temperature sub range within the full temperature range. The minimum span of the sub range is 51°C. The analog measuring output corresponds automatically to the selected sub range. This setting of a sub range can be done without recalibration of the pyrometer and does not affect the high accuracy and repeatability. As almost any sub range is adjustable, the storage of spare instruments or the replacement of other pyrometers is simplified.

# Output

The analog measuring outputs 0 to 20 mA or 4 to 20 mA are selectable as well as the serial digital interfaces RS232 or RS485. Additionally, the interface allows the controlling of the pyrometer via PC.

# Bus Control

The serial interface RS485 facilitates the integration of the pyrometer into existing field bus systems.

# Calibration

If a suitable calibration source is available, a calibration of the pyrometers can be done via serial interface without opening the housing.

Types With Fixed Optics
Types With Focusable Optics (Optics Inserted/pulled Out)

IS 12-S AND IGA 12-S WITH INTEGRATED SCANNER

The pyrometers IS 12-S and IGA 12-S with fixed optics are equipped with a scanning mechanism built into the pyrometer housing which moves the measuring beam up and down. In combination with the pyrometer's maximum value storage (peak picker), the scanner is optimally used for scanning of thin oscillating wires, for finding scalefree spots on heavily scaled surfaces or for measuring small, hot objects whose position is not exactly determined.

Fixed Optics

|Measuring Distance a [mm]|Scanning Distance at 4° Scanning Angle|
|---|---|
|80|5.6 mm|
|160|11.2 mm|
|250|17.5 mm|
|660|46 mm|
|1300|91 mm|
|5600|391 mm|

All instruments are equipped with a thru-lens view finder and an additional laser targeting light for exact alignment to the position of the measuring object. The scanning angle is adjustable between 0 and 4° and the scanning frequency is between 4 and 10 Hz.

The moving measuring beam does not increase the spot sizes due to the very fast exposure time of the pyrometers. The scanning length increases with increasing measuring distance. An overview of the scanning length at the different distances of the optics is shown in the table.

# OPTICS

The pyrometers are equipped with fixed or focusable optics. Spot sizes for fixed optics are shown for the specified measuring distance. The focusable optics offer the smallest possible spot size at the required distance. The spot sizes are shown in the following tables (all distances are measured from the front of the lens).

For spot sizes between those in the table, values can be found by interpolation. The optics can be changed at any time to another of the same type without recalibrating the pyrometer. The focusable type is available for 6 different distance ranges. Each measuring distance can be adjusted within the mentioned limits to achieve the smallest spot size in the required distance.

The selection of a suitable optics depends on different factors:

- Very short measuring distances up to 250 mm to achieve extremely small spot sizes are only available as fixed optics.
- The rotary mirror attachment ROT 10 can only be used in combination with fixed optics.
- The 3 focusable optics allow the exact adjustment of any required measuring distance from 277 mm.
- Focusable optics offer high flexibility to adapt the instrument to applications with different measuring distances.

|Fixed Optics|IS 12, IS 12-S, IGA 12, IGA 12-S|Spot sizes differing from the stated values can be calculated with the following equations:| | | |

# ROTARY MIRROR ATTACHMENT ROT 10 (ACCESSORY)

For larger scanning distances than the integrated scanner, the rotary mirror attachment ROT 10 can be mounted on the IS 12 and IGA 12 with fixed optics. So a scanning angle between 63 and 73° can be achieved (depending on the measuring range).

Typical applications of the rotary mirror attachment are measurements of thin oscillating wires or moving sheets and capturing the maximum temperature of bulk material or scaled metals.

With help of a rotating mirror the measuring beam of the pyrometer is moved over the measuring object in a line. If the instrument is equipped with a laser targeting light, the scanning distance can be followed visually.

# An overview of the scanning distances of the different measuring distances is shown in the following table:

|Fixed Optics|Measuring Distance|Scanning Distance|
|---|---|---|
|2|54 mm|130 mm|
|3|144 mm|261 mm|
|4|554 mm|857 mm|
|5|1194 mm|1768 mm|
|6|5494 mm|8035 mm|

The pyrometer has to be adjusted to the fastest exposure time due to the mirror rotation, to keep the smallest spot size. The high mirror rotation speed of the mirror produces spot sizes in form of a line. For the different temperature ranges (MB), the following spot sizes are achieved:

|Fixed Optics|Measuring Distance| |Spot Size M90 [mm]| | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|2|54 mm|2.1 x 0.7| | | | |
|144 mm|4.8 x 1.0| | | | | |
|554 mm|16.8 x 2.3| | | | | |
|1194 mm|36.8 x 5.5| | | | | |
| | | | |3|54 mm|2.0 x 0.6|
|144 mm| |4.6 x 0.8| | | | |
|554 mm| |16.5 x 2.0| | | | |
|1194 mm| |35.1 x 3.8| | | | |
|4|54 mm| |1.8 x 0.4| | | |
|144 mm| | |4.3 x 0.5| | | |
|554 mm| | |15.7 x 1.2| | | |
|1194 mm| | |34.1 x 2.8| | | |
|5|54 mm| | |1.6 x 0.2| | |
|144 mm| | | |4.1 x 0.3| | |
|554 mm| | | |15.2 x 0.7| | |
|1194 mm| | | |32.7 x 1.4| | |
| | |6|54 mm| | | |
| | | |144 mm| | | |
| | | |554 mm| | | |
| | | |1194 mm| | | |

Scanning Angle: 63°, 68°, 72°, 73°

The scanning frequency is permanently set to 12.5 Hz. The attachment is powered by 24 V AC, 50 Hz.

The signal is analyzed via the pyrometer’s analog output (0/4 to 20 mA) and / or the serial interface (RS232 or RS485).

# INFRAWIN 5 OVERVIEW

InfraWin is easy-to-use measurement and evaluation software for remote configuration of stationary, digital Impac brand pyrometers.

This software allows the user to remotely adjust and control settings for one or two pyrometers from a single computer. InfraWin also allows the user to simultaneously monitor and control temperatures.

- Display temperature data as color bars and online graphics
- Capture downstream evaluations as tables, graphics or text files
- Calculate the spot size for different measuring distances
- Features UPP standard (Universal Pyrometer Protocol)

# Pyrometer Settings

An Impac digital pyrometer connected to a PC will be automatically detected by the software. All available parameters are adjustable, including emissivity, response time, maximum value storage, output signal, and sub-range.

Further special functions are adjustable, for example, controllers or TV parameters on instruments available with these functions. Changes are transmitted directly to the pyrometer.

# Measurement with Color Bar

In this window, a temperature value for the upper or lower limit can be adjusted numerically or with the mouse. The acquired minimum and maximum value is indicated as well as the inner temperature of the pyrometer. The emissivity is changeable during the measurement at any time.

# Infrared Calculator

After input of the aperture and the focused spot size per datasheet, the calculation of spot sizes at non-focused distances is possible.

Measurement with Internal Temperature of radiation temperature and internal instrument temperature. Parameters can be changed during the measurement.

I/O Module allows users to trigger measurement externally and gives a potential free output contact.
