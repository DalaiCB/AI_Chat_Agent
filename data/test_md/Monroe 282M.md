# MONROE 282M

Pocket-sized, easy-to-use 20 kV/cm non-contacting static meter which produces consistently accurate readings.

# Digital Stat Arc 3

MONROE

The Monroe 282M 20 kV/cm range digital Stat-ArcTM fieldmeter is a pocket-sized, non-contacting static meter for consistently accurate readings. Simply hold the instrument so the range finder LED beams from a non-pulsing circle indicating you're at exactly the right distance from the target for readings up to 2000 V.

# PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS

- 20 kV/cm range
- LED pulsed beam range finder identifies calibrated distance from the surface
- Exclusive Auto-Zero circuit
- Hold button captures transient readings
- Chopper-stabilized measurement technique works in the presence of ionization
- Recorder output and 40-hour battery
- Drift-free accuracy even in ionized environments
- Optional Charge Plate System for testing ionization systems

# TYPICAL APPLICATIONS

- Monitoring "static-free" electronic workstations
- Measuring static build-up on webs in converting, laminating, and printing operations
- Checking grounds and bonding in dry particle/power transport systems

# MONROE ELECTROSTATIC FIELD METER 282M

EASY-TO-USE OPERATION

1. Turn the instrument ON.
2. Discharge your body by touching a grounded metal object.
3. Point the aperture toward a grounded object and press the ZERO button.
4. Aim the aperture toward the target surface at a distance of 1 cm. Adjust the distance until the flashing beams of the LEDs in the instrument converge. Read the voltage and polarity of the charged surface on the meter display. For additional measurements, repeat step four. To read the voltages, start at a greater distance to the target as given under specifications.

Maintenance

The battery should be replaced annually, whenever you plan an extended period of unattended monitoring, or whenever "BAT" appears on the display for more than an instant. To obtain accurate and drift-free readings, the sensor plate and especially the area around the aperture must be kept absolutely clean at all times. Never touch the aperture with anything—not even a cotton swab.
