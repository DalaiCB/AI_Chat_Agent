# TREK PD06078

Four-channel electrostatic voltmeter for monitoring critical operations associated with semiconductor, LCD, electronic assembly, and other processes with static charge.

The Trek® PD06078 contains four electrostatic voltmeters in a single enclosure. Each channel features a measurement range of 0 to ±10 kV and accuracy better than 5% reading plus ±0.2% of full scale over the probe to surface separation distance of 15 to 30 mm. Each channel of the Trek PD06078 utilizes a DC stable electrostatic field chopper probe which can be remotely located and easily positioned within process equipment to provide highly accurate, non-contacting, spacing independent, voltage measurements in either ionized or non-ionized environments.

# PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS

- Four electrostatic voltmeters in a single enclosure
- Voltage output monitors and 4 to 20 mA current loop outputs provide accurate and concise measurement results for each ESVM channel and can provide additional signal interfacing to facility monitoring equipment
- Front panel LED provides visual monitoring for each channel (switch selectable)
- Two probes types available: side view probe and a 45° angle probe
- Chopper probes are DC stable with or without incident air ion flow
- Drift-free measurements
- Patented probe design significantly improves noise and drift performance, both in the presence of contaminating particulates and under conditions of high humidity and wide temperature ranges
- NIST-traceable Certificate of Calibration provided with each unit
