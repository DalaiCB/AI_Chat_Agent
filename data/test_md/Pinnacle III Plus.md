# PINNACLE PLUS+ SERIES

Fastest Arc Response in Industry — Least Arc Damage

Pinnacle Plus+ series of pulsed DC power supplies store less than 1 mJ per 1 kW of output for the shortest arc recovery time in the industry. With a hard-arc detection time of <25 μs, they are approximately ten times faster than competing units. Process interruption is negligible. Hard arc shutdown from full power results in power interruption of less than 200 μs.

Configurable Arc Response

Sophisticated arc-handling capabilities enable you to easily program voltage trip level, delay to shutdown, and shutdown time to match your process. For additional ease, Pinnacle series units automatically implement pre-set process values when you select your target type (metal or nonmetal).

Maximum Process Efficiency

With the highest efficiency and power factor in the industry, the Pinnacle platform offers both the lowest operating and installed cost.

|---|---|---|---|
|The elimination of high-voltage switches and current-diversion circuits results in superior reliability, as well as superior process performance in the form of high output-voltage consistency and a highly accurate, fast ramp response.| | | |

Minimized Conditioning Time for New Targets

Target conditioning cycle (TCC) mode ensures the shortest conditioning time by limiting output power based on arc rate and average power delivered.

No Tap Changes, Wide, Full-Power Tap

Pinnacle units deliver a full-power tap over a 6.25:1 impedance range — without tap changes. Competitive supplies have a gap in coverage with little overlap.

Precise Process Control

A variety of innovative features maximize process control:

- Joule mode enables you to set delivered energy during each process run and adjusts for ramp time and lost energy during arc events.
- User-selectable and programmable parameters put process control at your fingertips:
- Selectable operation as a power, current, or voltage source
- Programmable ramp/run recipes
- Programmable process limits for output level as well as strike and process voltage

16-bit control circuitry enables the fastest, most accurate ramp-to-set point response in the industry.

Non-volatile memory stores and preserves recent settings in case of an unexpected shutdown.

Compact, Versatile Package

Pinnacle Plus+ supplies require only 3U for all options of pulsed power supplies. Single-output 1.5 kW, 5 kW, 10 kW units, as well as dual-output 1.5 kW and 5 kW units are available. Flexible master/slaving allows up to 14 units configured together. Any unit is easily designated as either master or slave, making units of the same configuration interchangeable.

Display/Control Options

The Pinnacle platform offers the following options:

- Active front panel offers complete unit control, with adjustable settings for joule mode, output limits, ramp/run recipes, and arc response.
- Passive front panel. Allows visual monitoring by an operator.
- Multiple I/O protocols. Allow you to adjust settings as with an active remote panel. Analog selections are available in isolated and non-isolated 15- and 24- VDC configurations. Digital selections include AE Bus (RS-232, RS-422, RS-485), Profibus, and DeviceNet™.
