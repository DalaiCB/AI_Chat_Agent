# TREK 323

Highly sensitive versatile instrument used for a variety of electrostatic applications including material evaluation, electret studies, charge accumulation, etc.

The Trek® 323 electrostatic voltmeter performs highly sensitive voltage measurements using a variety of Trek sideview probes with various body types (round, square). The Trek 323 is specifically designed for high sensitivity applications and performs highly accurate, non-contacting measurement of electrostatic potentials of 0 to 100 V over a wide range of probe-to-surface distances.
