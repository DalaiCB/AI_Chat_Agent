Advanced Energy’s Artesyn LCM4000HV series and associated LCM12K mounting shelf has been designed specifically to provide a centralized current source for medium to large scale LED lighting and horticulture applications. The unique input design allows all standard AC inputs 208 VAC to 600 VAC from single to 3 phase sources. The output of each 4 kW block provides flicker free current source from 0 to 16 A at an output voltage range between 100 VDC to 300 VDC. High nominal operating voltage provides the benefits of lower cost standard wiring and higher efficiency with minimal voltage drop over long distance. For large systems stacking 10 shelves in a short 10U cabinet would provide 120 kW for a normal sized grow area.
