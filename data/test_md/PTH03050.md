# ARTESYN PTH03050 3.3 Vin Single Output

Advanced Energy's Artesyn PTH03050 series non-isolated DC-DC converter complies with the Point-of-Load Alliance (POLA) standard. It offers some of the most advanced POL functions in the industry, including Auto-Track™ sequencing for controlled power-up/power-down of complex semiconductor devices such as DSPs, FPGAs, and ASICs. Standard features include pre-bias startup, input undervoltage lockout, remote sense, remote On/Off, and auto-resetting short-circuit protection.

PTH03050 series converters have an input voltage range of 2.95 to 3.65 Vdc and an output voltage that can be trimmed from 0.8 to 2.5 Vdc to meet a wide variety of semiconductor power needs. Rated at 15 watts, the converters offer up to 94% efficiency and can deliver up to 6 amps. Available in through-hole horizontal mount and surface-mount versions, they have a small 0.5 x 0.87 inch (12.7 x 22.1 mm) footprint and an installed height of just 0.33 inch (8.5 mm).

# PTH03050

OUTPUT VOLTAGE ADJUSTMENT

The ultra-wide output voltage trim range offers major advantages to users who select the PTH03050. It is no longer necessary to purchase a variety of modules in order to cover different output voltages. The output voltage can be trimmed in a range of 0.8 Vdc to 2.5 Vdc. When the PTH03050 converter leaves the factory the output has been adjusted to the default voltage of 0.8 V.

|Output Voltage|Efficiency|
|---|---|
|Vo = 1.0 V|87%|
|Vo = 1.2 V|88%|
|Vo = 1.5 V|90%|
|Vo = 1.8 V|91%|
|Vo = 2.0 V|92%|
|Vo = 2.5 V|94%|

Notes:

1. Remote ON/OFF. Positive Logic
- ON: Pin 3 open; or V > Vin - 0.5 V
- OFF: Pin 3 GND; or V < 0.8 V (min - 0.2 V).
2. See Figures 1 for safe operating curves.
3. A 100 μF electrolytic input capacitor is required for proper operation. The capacitor must be rated for a minimum of 300 mA rms of ripple current.
4. An external output capacitor is not required for basic operation. Adding 100 μF of distributed capacitance at the load will improve the transient response.
5. 1 A/μs load step, 50 to 100% Iomax, Cout = 100 μF.
6. If utilized Vout will track applied voltage by ±0.3 V (up to Vo set point).
7. The pre-bias start-up feature is not compatible with Auto-Track™. This is because when the module is under Auto-Track™ control, it is fully active and will sink current if the output voltage is below that of a back-feeding source. Therefore to ensure a pre-bias hold-off, one of the following two techniques must be followed when input power is first applied to the module. The Auto-Track™ function must either be disabled, or the module’s output held off using the Inhibit pin. Refer to Application Note 153 for more details.
8. Tape and reel packaging only available on the surface-mount versions.
9. NOTICE: Some models do not support all options. Please contact your local Artesyn representative or use the on-line model number search tool at http://www.artesyn.com to find a suitable alternative.
