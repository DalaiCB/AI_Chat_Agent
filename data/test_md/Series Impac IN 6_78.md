# IMPAC IN 6/78

OVERVIEW

The version IN 6/78-L is equipped with optics with a better field of view for the measurement of small objects. The high-speed version IN 6/78-H has a shorter exposure time of only 30 ms and is suited for fast measuring tasks.

The full digital core sensor design of the IN 6/78 provides a wide temperature range with high accuracy. The pyrometer is equipped with specially designed and coated high-end optics, which reduce the effects of ambient reflectance and guarantee the best possible accuracy.

You can connect the pyrometers to a PC through an RS485 to USB connection. You can then use the InfraWin software to make parameter adjustments, get temperature details, log data, and further analyze your complete temperature processes.

# IMPAC IN 6/78

# INFRAWIN 5 OVERVIEW

InfraWin is easy-to-use measurement and evaluation software for remote configuration of stationary, digital Impac brand pyrometers.

This software allows the user to remotely adjust and control settings for one or two pyrometers from a single computer. InfraWin also allows the user to simultaneously monitor and control temperatures.

- Display temperature data as color bars and online graphics
- Capture downstream evaluations as tables, graphics or text files
- Calculate the spot size for different measuring distances
- Features UPP standard (Universal Pyrometer Protocol)

# Pyrometer Settings

An Impac digital pyrometer connected to a PC will be automatically detected by the software. All available parameters are adjustable, including emissivity, response time, maximum value storage, output signal and sub range.

Further special functions are adjustable, for example controllers or TV parameters on instruments available with these functions. Changes are transmitted directly to the pyrometer.

# Measurement with Color Bar

In this window a temperature value for the upper or lower limit can be adjusted numerically or with the mouse. The acquired minimum and maximum value is indicated as well as the inner temperature of the pyrometer. The emissivity is changeable during the measurement at any time.

# Infrared Calculator

After input of the aperture and the focused spot size per datasheet, the calculation of spot sizes at non-focused distances is possible.

|O°C|82.9PC|
|---|---|
|104.7°C|110.0PC|

# Measurement with Internal Temperature

Measurement of radiation temperature and internal instrument temperature. Parameters can be changed during the measurement.

I/O Module allows users to trigger measurement externally and gives a potential free output contact.
