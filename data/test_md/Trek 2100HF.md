TREK 2100HF

High-frequency, high-speed, and high voltage power amplifier with an all-solid-state design for high slew rate TREK and low-noise operation for high power applications.

The Trek® 2100 HF is a high-frequency, high-speed, wide bandwidth amplifier for high power applications. It incorporates an all-solid-state design for highly reliable low-noise operation, thus achieving accurate output response and high slew rates, even in highly capacitive loads. Full power frequency response of the amplifier is essentially flat up to 2 MHz. No overshoot or instability of the waveform occurs due to the amplifier’s unique dual feedback feature.
