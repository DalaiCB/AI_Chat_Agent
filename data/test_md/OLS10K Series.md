# HITEK POWER OLS10K SERIES

10 KW HIGH VOLTAGE POWER SUPPLIES

The HiTek Power® OLS10K series single-output high voltage power supplies meet the exacting requirements found in electron-beam, ion-beam, and x-ray systems, as well as ion and chemical vapor deposition, electrostatic precipitation, and other 24/7 production processes. Designed using the latest power-switching IGBTs to ensure efficient and reliable operation over the full operating range, the OLS10K will give exemplary performance in the most severe of electrical environments. The OLS10K series achieves an exceptionally high packing density for high voltage power supplies of this power level, giving 169 W per liter, 2.7 W per inch3.

The 6U construction allows operation at full power when close mounted in a standard equipment rack, giving significant savings in rack space in large systems. Featuring a proprietary Arc Count and Extinguish (ACE) system for managing systems where load arcing is endemic, the OLS10K series protects both itself and the load from damage that may be caused by excessive arcing while allowing normal operation to continue. The OLS10K series features both analog and remote control (optional RS232) interfaces. A full set of commands is available over the optional RS232 interface to control and monitor the operation of the power supply.

# ELECTRICAL SPECIFICATIONS (CONTINUED)

# Physical Specifications

|Safety|The OLS10K series meets the requirements of the Low Voltage Directive (LVD), 2006/95/EC, by complying with BS EN61010-1 when installed as a component part of other equipment. The units are CE marked accordingly. Designed to meet the general requirements of SEMI S2 for electrical safety.|
|---|---|
|Safety Class|Equipment Class 1|
|Cooling|The unit utilizes forced air cooling. Air is drawn in via the front panel slotted opening and through side panel vents. Ensure that within the rack there is a free air opening with a minimum effective area of 195 cm2 directly in front of the unit front panel slots. An additional free air opening with a minimum effective area of 195 cm2 is required for the side vents. Air flow from this additional free air opening to the side vents of the power converter must not be restricted. The expected air flow for each opening is approximately 50 liters per second. The maximum temperature of the air entering the unit must not exceed 40°C. The unit can dissipate up to 2 kW, therefore provision must be made to extract the exhaust air from the rack in order to prevent possible overheating.|
|EMC|Intended for installation as a component of a system and designed to meet: - EN55022 class B for conducted and radiated emissions
- EN61000-4-2 ESD - levels ±4 kV contact, 8 kV air discharge
- EN61000-4-4 fast transients on mains input - levels ±2 kV
- EN61000-4-5 surges - levels ±2 kV line to earth, ±1 kV line to line
- EN61000-4-8 magnetic fields - levels 30 A/m at 50/60 Hz
- EN61000-4-11 voltage dips, interruptions
The unit will not trip and recovers to normal operation after a disturbance as defined in SEMI F47-0706. The EMC performance of the power supply can only be fully assessed when installed within, and as part of, the final system.|
|RoHS|The OLS10K series meets the requirements of EU Directive 2011/65/EU on the Restriction of use of certain Hazardous Substances (RoHS) in electrical and electronic equipment.|
