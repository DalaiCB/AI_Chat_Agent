Notes:

1. Parts must be completely assembled.
2. For label printing details, refer to ips.
3. Quality controlled dimensions. These dimensions to be included in the mechanical cpk of 1.33
4. Casing parts used must have matching color. In order to ensure color matching of parts, it is required that the raw material that will be processed by the fabricator will come from the same supplier and the sheetmetal fabricator for all matching parts must be the same. To avoid color variations on the same lot delivered, all parts with matching color requirement should be delivered as a set by the fabricator.
5. Sheared edges visible to the customer should have no rust formation. If rust formation is present then a concealing layer of silver ink or some other substitute should be applied on the rusted area.
6. Mounting locations screw penetration depth is 4.6Mm max.
