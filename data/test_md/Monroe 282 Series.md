# MONROE 282IS AND 282A-1

Full-featured, hand-held fieldmeters for performing static surveys and evaluate charge accumulation in electronic manufacturing and in industrial operations.

The Monroe 282-IS Digital Stat-ArcTM 2 and Monroe 282A-1 Digital Stat-ArcTM 3 are pocket-sized, non-contacting static meters for consistently accurate readings. Simply hold the instrument so the range finder LED beams from a non-pulsing circle indicating you're at exactly the right distance from the target for readings up to 20 kV.

# PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS

- Easy-to-read digital display of field strength provides quantitative data with 100V resolution
- LED pulsed beam range finder identifies calibrated distance from the surface
- Chopper-stabilized measurement technique works in the presence of ionization
- Recorder output to pass measurements to auxiliary instruments to display or record the data
- Drift-free accuracy even in ionized environments
- Optional Charge Plate System for testing ionization systems
- Monroe 282IS is UL approved for use in hazardous environments

CAUTION: DO NOT DROP

EASY-TO-USE OPERATION

1. Turn the instrument ON.
2. Discharge your body by touching a grounded metal object.
3. Point the aperture toward a grounded object and press the ZERO button.
4. Aim the aperture toward the target surface at a distance of 1 in. Adjust the distance until the flashing beams of the LEDs in the instrument converge. Read the voltage and polarity of the charged surface on the meter display. For additional measurements, repeat step four. To freeze the display, press the HOLD button. To read the voltages, start at a greater distance to the target as given under specifications.

Maintenance

The battery should be replaced annually, whenever you plan an extended period of unattended monitoring, or whenever "BAT" appears on the display for more than an instant. To obtain accurate and drift-free readings, the sensor plate and especially the area around the aperture must be kept absolutely clean at all times. Never touch the aperture with anything—not even a cotton swab.
