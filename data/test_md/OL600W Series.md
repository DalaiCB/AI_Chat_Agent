|Arc Count and Extinguish (ACE)| |Each time the ACE system detects an arc, it blanks the supply off for a brief period to extinguish the arc. The unit is then allowed to recover. If more arcs occur, they are counted to determine the arc rate; if this exceeds a safe level, the power supply is shut down. The parameters are factory set.|

# Metering

Provided as part of an alphanumeric display. Voltages are displayed with a resolution > 0.5% of rated output. Current is displayed with a resolution of > 1.5% of rated output. Voltage and current set values can be displayed by pressing the relevant control potentiometer.

# Status Indication

Uses the alphanumeric display to show the reason for any trip condition.

# Cooling

Fan assisted with fan fail detection. Air inlets at the rear of the unit, exhaust on the side panels and top cover. Min air flow required is 3 m/s at the input to the fan. For slide mounting, a 15 mm gap shall be provided above the unit for air exhaust if the side air vents are blocked. For shelf mounting the 1 U, no gap is required above or below the unit provided the side air vents are clear by at least 15 mm. The 2 U requires a 15mm gap above the unit as well.

# INTERFACE

Remote control
25-way female D-type connector

All logical indicators are open collector outputs rated at 16 V (max) in the off state. An internal 100 Ω resistor is connected in series with the open collector transistor. The pull-down voltage is 0.9 V plus the internal resistor drop. The rated current is 10 mA.

All analog voltage and current monitors are 0 to +10 V ±0.5% ±20 mV, with respect to pin 13, representing 0 to rated output. Signal impedance < 100 Ω and minimum external load resistance is 2 kΩ.

All analog voltage and current inputs are 0 to +10 V on the HI input with respect to the LO input representing 0 V to rated output ±0.2% of setting ±0.1% of rating. Input impedance > 50 kΩ.
