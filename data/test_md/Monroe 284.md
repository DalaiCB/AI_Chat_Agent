MONROE 284

NanoCoulomb meter offers the ability to make direct measurements of charge on materials via battery operation in two ranges: 200 nC and 20 nC.

The Monroe 284 NanoCoulomb meter enables the user to easily and accurately measure the charge generated on items such as electronic components by triboelectric charging processes. Static charges can build up on ICs as they vibrate and slide in shipping tubes or on PC boards as they move around in contact with protective packaging materials. The Monore 284 aids in the selection and evaluation of packaging materials when performing triboelectric charge testing as outlined in the Electronics Industries Association Standards for ESD sensitive Items (EIA-541).

Two interchangeable standard sizes of Faraday Cups serve most needs with inner dimensions of 25/8 dia. x 2¾ in deep and 5¾ dia. x 7 in deep with custom sizes available. Individual areas of semiconductor components, MR heads or other small static-sensitive devices may be examined to evaluate manual or automatic handling techniques. Contact is made to individual leads via the tip of an ordinary 1X passive oscilloscope probe.
