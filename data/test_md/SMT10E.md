# OUTPUT VOLTAGE ADJUSTMENT

The ultra-wide output voltage trim range offers major advantages to users who select the SMT10E-05W3V3J. It is no longer necessary to purchase a variety of modules in order to cover different output voltages. The output voltage can be trimmed in a range of 0.8 Vdc to 3.63 Vdc. When the SMT10E-05W3V3J converter leaves the factory the output has been adjusted to the default voltage of 3.3V.

- When Vin >4.5 V, then Vout can be adjusted from 0.8 - 3.6 Vdc
- When Vin <4.5 V, then Vout can be adjusted from 0.8 - 2.75 Vdc

# Notes:

1. When Vin ≥ 4.5 V, then Vout can be adjusted from 0.8 Vdc to 3.6 Vdc. When Vin < 4.5 V, then Vout can be adjusted from 0.8 Vdc to 2.75 Vdc.
2. The SMT10E features a ‘Negative Logic’ Remote ON/OFF operation. If not using the Remote ON/OFF pin, leave the pin open (the converter will be on). The Remote ON/OFF pin is referenced to ground.

Configuration

|Remote pin open circuit|Unit is ON|
|---|---|
|Remot pin pulled low|Unit is ON|
|Remote pin pulled high [Von/off > 1.2 V]|Unit is OFF|

A ‘Positive Logic’ Remote ON/OFF version is also possible with this converter. To order please place the suffix ‘-R’ at the end of the model number, e.g. SMT10E-05W3V3-RJ.

1. Full derating curves available in both the Longform (Technical Reference) and Application Note 168.
2. NOTICE: Some models do not support all options. Please contact your local Artesyn Embedded Power representative or use the on-line model number search tool at http://www.artesyn.com to find a suitable alternative.
