Advanced Energy's Artesyn ASA series of high-input 6 watt isolated DC-DC converters features an ultra wide 4:1 input voltage range of 18–75 Vdc and is primarily designed for use with nominal 48 V supplies. There is a choice of four single output models, offering voltages of 3.3 V, 5 V, 12 V or 15 V, and three dual output models offering +5/-5 V, +12/-12 V or +15/-15 V. The converters are fully encapsulated in a compact 1.25 x 0.8 inch (31.7 x 20.3 mm) metal case and have a height of just 0.4 inch (10.2 mm). They are ideal for ruggedized applications involving harsh environments.
