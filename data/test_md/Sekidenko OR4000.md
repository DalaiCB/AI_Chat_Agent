IMPROVE TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENT ACCURACY

Advanced Energy’s OR4000T and OR4000E multi-channel optical fiber thermometers (OFTs) deliver accurate, non-contact temperature and emissivity measurements in a compact, modular platform designed to meet each unique application’s requirements. AE’s OFTs are ideally suited to measure temperature in the most tightly controlled applications where uniform, repeatable temperatures are required to enable process success.

Depending on the application, the following choices are available:

- The OR4000T model is used in RTP, laser annealing, HDP-CVD, MOCVD, ALD, UV Cure, solar cell packaging, and HDD processing.
- The OR4000E model is used in Epi, CVD, MOCVD, and other processes with changing substrate emissivity.

ENHANCE REPEATABILITY AND MINIMIZE VARIATION

Traditional thermocouple measurement is unsuitable for many applications where physical contact with the substrate will cause damage and inaccuracy due to heat transfer effects. The OR4000T and OR4000E OFTs measure direct target temperature in situ—without contacting the object to be measured—for enhanced point-to-point uniformity and improved accuracy in temperature readings.

Each OFT system consists of a controller, an optical sensor, and optical fiber cables. The sensor detects emitted near-infrared (NIR) light from the target, typically a substrate. A fiber optic cable then transmits the NIR light from the sensor to the controller, where the collected light is converted to a temperature reading. The use of a fiber optic cable allows for remote positioning of the controller in a controlled environment away from the process chamber. Each sensor is custom-designed to meet the functional and mechanical requirements of the unique, individual application. The results: reliable measurements, higher repeatability, and increased yield.

INCREASE PRODUCTIVITY, YIELD, AND THROUGHPUT

Both the OR4000T and OR4000E models deliver high-speed performance with read rates up to 2 kHz, enabling accurate tracking of rapid temperature changes. In dynamic applications, this enables closed-loop temperature control and optimizes process yield.

INCREASE STABILITY AND RELIABILITY ACROSS MULTIPLE CHAMBERS AND SUBSTRATE MATERIALS

The OR4000T model provides multi-channel temperature measurement utilizing up to four independently operating channels tailored to specific operating requirements. This feature enables uniform, integrated measurements within multiple chambers.

The OR4000E model offers dual-channel capability, with real-time emissivity monitoring to provide accurate and repeatable temperature measurements in film growth applications. Typical processes that benefit from this capability are CVD processes and thermal annealing processes where significant material change occurs. The OR4000E model measures emissivity and temperature simultaneously by pulsing incident radiation on the substrate and determining its reflectivity, then measuring the radiant energy that the target emits when the source of radiation is off. The result: accurate and repeatable real-time temperature measurements, regardless of the substrate emissivity.
