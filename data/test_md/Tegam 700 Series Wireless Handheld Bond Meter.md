# Bluetooth"Model 730A BOND METER ASSEMBLED IN U.S.A.

Wireless Datalogging Handheld Bond Meter From the Low Resistance Experts. The only wireless portable bond meter assembled in the U.S.A that offers superior accuracy, 100–hour battery life, and a 3–year warranty.

INTEGRITY in measurement is essential when critical aircraft assemblies are inspected. Nothing ensures this more effectively than the 730A bond meter. It captures crucial readings and seamlessly connects them to any software system from spreadsheets to Quality Management without the integration headache. Advanced new tools that support IOS, Android and Windows are available with each instrument. You may be skeptical about how truly easy it is. See for yourself that seamless data collection is possible without complicating workflow. The new 700 series are also exceptional measurement tools that you can rely on every day with confidence.

PROBES are often more important than the instrument. No one has wider range of configurations to meet and adapt to your needs. From tight spacing to piercing paint, we have a handle and tip combination for virtually all applications. You can mix styles to make your job easier. The dual connector system permits a Kelvin Clip for one point of connection while the ergonomic tri-shape probe on the second lead can be used for accessing multiple points with one hand. The creative ergonomic design makes these instruments easy to hold, easy to read and easy to clean. Designed for one-handed operation, these tools are comfortable to carry and use for extended periods of time. Like all TEGAM products, the 700 Series bond meters are designed, assembled and tested in the United States. TEGAM backs this durable instrument with a 3–year warranty to assure you that your investment is sound.

For over 30 years, TEGAM has been building hand held instruments for challenging applications. TEGAM’s 700 Series extends that experience into highly portable bond meters tasked with producing reliable measurements in tight spaces encountered with aircraft. They are designed to be durable and easy to use, with advanced features for better measurements.

When the Measurement Matters, Be Certain with TEGAM.
