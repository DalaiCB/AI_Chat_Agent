# MIKRON M390S

Ultra-fast high temperature two piece calibration source with temperature range of 600 to 3000°C (1112 to 5432°F).

The Mikron® M390S ultra-fast high temperature blackbody calibrator is without parallel in its capability to produce very high temperature, high emissivity targets, and at the same time stabilize at the required temperature within a few minutes. The cavity is a graphite tube target with a 25 mm (1”) diameter with an effective emissivity of 1.0 from 0.65 to 1.8 μm. Target temperature is sensed by a rapid response Impac® infrared thermometer which drives a PID controller to regulate the target temperature precisely to the desired value.

# OVERVIEW

Blackbody calibration sources are infrared radiators of different sized apertures to adapt to the desired target area. Used for calibrating and verifying the output signals of infrared thermometers (pyrometers), thermal imaging systems, heat flux measurement systems, or spectrographic analysis systems. Advanced Energy supplies a unique selection of very precise calibration sources that are traceable to national standards. Quotations for custom designs and variations are available upon request.

Mikron calibration sources have long been the gold standard to calibrate the instruments that keep your operations up and running. These blackbodies are superior because of the emissivity values, homogeneous emission areas, and a wide range.
