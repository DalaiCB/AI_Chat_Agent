# Model 2818A RF POWER CALIBRATION AND MEASUREMENT ASSEMBLED IN U.S.A.

2818A 9 kHz to 18 GHz RF Power Transfer Standard From ADVANCED ENERGY / TEGAM, the leaders in power sensor calibration.

TRUST is an essential feature in any measurement tool, and TEGAM’s new 2818A RF Power Transfer Standard is a tool you can rely on every day with confidence.

Advanced Energya 2818A RF Power Standard TEGAM Test SENSOR RFIN Built upon proven technologies the 2818A offers new features and advantages in a RF Power Transfer Standard. Utilizing TEGAM’s transfer standard techniques applied to an internally-referenced thermoelectric sensor, the 2818A performs faster while retaining excellent overall performance and accuracy.

With a USB communication port, the 2818A operates without a power meter. Utilizing PS-CAL and a PC for data collection and as a digitized power meter, you retain the benefit of making manual measurement when you want them and collecting power readings automatically when a visual power reading is not needed. Eliminating a separate power meter also means less equipment to calibrate and less space needed on the bench or in the rack.

The 2818A is EEPROM based with the calibration constants stored within the sensor, eliminating the need for a separate electronic data media. Connect the 2818A to the PC, apply RF power, and read the corrected power level without applying calibration factors separately.

TEGAM’s PS-CAL® software has been updated to work with the 2818A in an automated power sensor calibration system. To accelerate your workload with the 2818A, you can now speed up the power sensor calibration process without sacrificing accuracy by adjusting the dwell time. The 2818A is over four times as fast as our current solution at settling on a power reading and transfers the time savings to your power sensor calibration workload.

Assembled in a familiar package, the 2818A will fit into the same space as an existing TEGAM RF Transfer standard, including utilization of the same rack-mount system. This allows the 2818A to drop into current TEGAM system locations without having to reconfigure the space. The 2818A is usable on the bench or in a rack and is ready to work for you.

Turn the 2818A into a fully automated power sensor calibration system. TEGAM specializes in Turn-Key RF power sensor calibration systems with decades of experience. We can help you to convert your existing TEGAM power sensor calibration system to utilize the 2818A or we can build one from the ground up. Our systems make it easier to add power sensor calibration capability to your laboratory. Contact us today to learn more.

TEGAM’s 30 years of microwave power measurement experience and field-proven instruments provide measurements you can trust.
