# TREK 542A

Electrostatic voltmeter for accurate non-contacting measurements of the electrostatic surface voltage associated with EOS/ESD processes.

The Trek® 542A electrostatic voltmeter provides accurate non-contacting measurements of the electrostatic surface voltage associated with EOS/ESD processes. The instrument is configured with a miniature electrostatic field chopper probe that can be remotely located and easily positioned within process equipment to provide highly accurate, non-contacting, DC-stable, spacing-independent voltage measurements in either ionized or non-ionized environments. A 20x4 alphanumeric LCD screen displays the present measured voltage, the positive peak voltage value, the negative peak voltage value and additional menu information.

# PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS

- Chopper probe is DC-stable with or without incident air ion flow
- Drift-free measurements
- LCD screen displays present voltage, the positive peak voltage, the negative peak voltage and additional menu information.
- Visual and audible alarms activate when the preset voltage threshold levels are reached
- Analog voltage monitor output
- USB and RS232 serial ports
- NIST-traceable Certificate of Calibration provided with each unit
- Optional walking test adapter kits available
