# OUTPUT VOLTAGE ADJUSTMENT

The ultra-wide output voltage trim range offers major advantages to users who select the SIL10E-05W3V3J. It is no longer necessary to purchase a variety of modules in order to cover different output voltages. The output voltage can be trimmed in a range of 0.8 Vdc to 3.63 Vdc. When the SIL10E-05W3V3J series converter leaves the factory the output has been adjusted to the default voltage of 3.3 V.

- When Vin >4.5 V, then Vout can be adjusted from 0.8 - 3.63 Vdc
- When Vin <4.5 V, then Vout can be adjusted from 0.8 - 2.75 Vdc

Notes:

1. When Vin > 4.5 V, then Vout can be adjusted from 0.8 V to 3.6 V. When Vin < 4.5 V, then Vout can be adjusted from 0.8 V to 2.75 V.
2. The SIL10E features a ‘Negative Logic’ Remote ON/OFF operation. If not using the Remote ON/OFF pin, leave the pin open (the converter will be on). The Remote ON/OFF pin is referenced to ground. The following conditions apply for the SIL10E:
- Configuration: Remote pin open circuit - Converter Operation: Unit is ON
- Configuration: Remote pin pulled low - Converter Operation: Unit is ON
- Configuration: Remote pin pulled high [Von/off > 1.2 V] - Converter Operation: Unit is OFF
3. Full derating curves available in both the Longform (Technical Reference) and Application Note 136.
4. For certain applications that use low ESR capacitors on the output of the convertor and to insure maximum converter stability, please add the suffix ‘02’ to the model, e.g. SIL10E-05S2V5-V02J.
5. NOTICE: Some models do not support all options. Please contact your local Advanced Energy’s Artesyn representative or use the on-line model number search tool at http://www.artesyn.com to find a suitable alternative.
6. All specifications are typical at nominal input, full load at 25 °C unless otherwise stated.
