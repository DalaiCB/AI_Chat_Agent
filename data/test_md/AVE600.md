# ARTESYN AVE600 SERIES

600 Watts

Advanced Energy's Artesyn AVE600 series half-brick isolated DATA SHEET DC-DC converter provides a single regulated low noise 12 Vdc output that can deliver up to 50 amps. It has a wide 2:1 input range of 36 to 75 Vdc and is designed primarily for use with standard 48 V telecommunications equipment supplies. This converter is normally used in designs with a distributed power architecture (DPA), where one or more downstream non-isolated DC-DC converters meet the needs of lower voltage semiconductor devices.
