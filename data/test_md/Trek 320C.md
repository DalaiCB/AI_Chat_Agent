# TREK 320C

Versatile instrument used for a variety of electrostatic applications including contact potential measurements, materials evaluation, and electret studies.

# AT A GLANCE

- Measurement Range: 0 to ±100 V DC or peak AC
- Sensitivity: 1 mV
- Speed of Response: Less than 300 ms for a 100 V step
- Measurement Accuracy: Better than 0.05% of full scale

# PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS

- Response speed control adjusts the speed/noise trade-off of the Trek 320C AC response
- Self-locking drift/spacing null adjustment minimizes the variation in monitored voltage values as the probe to test surface spacing changes
- Easy-to-read front panel 3.5 digit LED display
- Monitor the detected output voltage through a 1:1 voltage monitor output and a switch selectable scale of 10:1 or 20:1 voltage monitor output
- Patented low impedance probe assures measurement accuracy which is essentially independent of probe-to-test-surface spacing while eliminating the external environmental effects of high humidity and contamination, such as airborne dust, toner, ions and chemicals, on measurement accuracy
- NIST-traceable Certificate of Calibration provided with each unit
