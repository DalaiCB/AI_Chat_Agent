# OVERVIEW

For optimal match of the instrument to the application, two different optics are available. The small dimensions of the optics allow easy integration into compact production machines.

The LED targeting light enables precise alignment on the measurement object. It is automatically active and can be used during measurement.

In addition to the analog output, the pyrometer is equipped with a digital RS485 interface, which enables secure data transmission to a PC or a PLC over long distances.

The included InfraWin software enables graphical display and storage of measurement values, as well as easy set-up of all instrument parameters.

# IMPAC IGA 320/23-LO Optical Head

Depending on the application, the instrument will be delivered with a small or a large optical head. The selection of the optical head depends not only on its size but also on the required spot size (size of the measuring object) and the measuring distance. Distance "a" is specified from the front of the lens.

Optical Head Type I (Fixed Adjusted)

With the very small dimensions, the optical head Type I is suited for use in confined spaces. The optics is adjusted ex works to one of the measuring distances mentioned in the table below. The mentioned spot size will be achieved in exactly this distance, however other distances can be realized on request.

Optical Head Type II (Focusable)

The optical head Type II is focusable, i.e. each measuring distance can be adjusted within the mentioned limits to achieve the smallest spot size in the required distance. The spot size at the shortest and longest distance is mentioned in the table below. Spot sizes at intermediate distances can be calculated by interpolation.

# IMPAC IGA 320/23-LO

OPTICAL LIGHTPIPE OPTICS

The IGA 320/23-LO can also use a sapphire optical rod ("lightpipe") as the optics to collect the infrared radiation from the target. Lightpipes can be inserted through small holes or vacuum fittings and can survive harsh temperature and pressure environments as well as strong RF fields. This configuration is ideal for applications using induction heating or when there is not optical access for a traditional lens solution to have sufficient viewing access to the target. Versions with lightpipe optics are available as a special on request.

# INFRAWIN 5 OVERVIEW

InfraWin is easy-to-use measurement and evaluation software for remote configuration of stationary, digital Impac brand pyrometers. This software allows the user to remotely adjust and control settings for one or two pyrometers from a single computer. InfraWin also allows the user to simultaneously monitor and control temperatures.

- Display temperature data as color bars and online graphics
- Capture downstream evaluations as tables, graphics or text files
- Calculate the spot size for different measuring distances
- Features UPP standard (Universal Pyrometer Protocol)

Pyrometer Settings: An Impac digital pyrometer connected to a PC will be automatically detected by the software. All available parameters are adjustable, including emissivity, response time, maximum value storage, output signal and sub range.

Further special functions are adjustable, for example, controllers or TV parameters on instruments available with these functions. Changes are transmitted directly to the pyrometer.

Measurement with Color Bar: In this window, a temperature value for the upper or lower limit can be adjusted numerically or with the mouse. The acquired minimum and maximum value is indicated as well as the inner temperature of the pyrometer. The emissivity is changeable during the measurement at any time.
