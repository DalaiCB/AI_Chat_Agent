# TREK 821HH INFINITRON®

Hand held electrostatic voltmeter to measure the voltage level of both conductive and insulative objects and surfaces with virtually zero charge transfer.

The Trek® 821HH Infinitron® hand held electrostatic voltmeter represents the next generation of contacting precision surface voltage measuring instruments, providing input characteristics far beyond the limits of any currently available hand held voltmeter product. The Trek 821HH can easily measure the voltage level of both conductive and insulative objects and surfaces with virtually zero charge transfer to the measurement probe. This results in stable high accuracy voltage measurement capability for ESD sensitive devices.

# PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS

- Probe tip assumes the voltage level of the measured object’s surface as the tip approaches resulting in no current flow at the time of contact.
- Battery or line operation
- Easy-to-read LCD display
- Records voltage, temperature and humidity with included sensor
- Data graphing capabilities
- NIST-traceable Certificate of Calibration provided with each unit
