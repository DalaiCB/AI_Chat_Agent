Digital Architecture

An inherently adaptable design enables precise process measurement and control, as well as easy integration of advanced functions — eliminating the complexity and lead times typically associated with hardware changes.

Wide Power Coverage

A wide set point range, from 5 to 6000 W, accommodates changing RF requirements, making process development more efficient by eliminating the need for new-product integrations and learning curves.

Pulsing

The RF pulsing performance of the Paramount HF power supply reduces charge buildup, arcing, and feature distortion during etching.
