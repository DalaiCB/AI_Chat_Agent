MONROE 287B

Performs manual or automatic decay and balance tests for periodic verification of ionization equipment.

The Monroe 287B ionizer performance analyzer performs manual or automatic decay and balance tests for periodic verification of ionization equipment. It then stores the results and averaged decay times for up to ten manual tests and up to ten complete automatic test sequences. Temperature and relative humidity are displayed real-time and recorded with the test data.

All instrument functions are controlled by four push buttons. In decay mode, a built-in high voltage generator charges the plate to over 1050 volts. During testing, the plate will discharge toward zero in the presence of ionization. The elapsed time of decay between 1000 volts and 100 volts is displayed. In the balance mode, isolated plate voltage, test duration, and ± peak voltages are displayed.
