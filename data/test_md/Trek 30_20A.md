# TREK 30/20A

High voltage power amplifier with an all-solid-state design for high slew rate, wide bandwidth, and low-noise operation.

The Trek® 30/20A is a DC-stable, high voltage power amplifier featuring an all solid-state design for high slew rate, wide bandwidth, and low-noise operation. Configured as non-inverting with a fixed gain of 3000 V/V, it is protected against over-voltage and over-current conditions that may be generated by active loads or by output short circuits to ground.

# TECHNICAL DATA

|Environmental Specifications| |
|---|---|
|Temperature|0 to 40°C (32 to 104°F)|
|Relative Humidity|Up to 75%, noncondensing|
|Altitude|Up to 1524 meters (5000 ft)|

# Features

|Settling Time (to 1%)|Less than 200 μs for a 0 to 30 kV step|
|---|---|
|Dynamic Adjustment|Graduated one-turn panel potentiometer is used to optimize the AC response for various load parameters.|
|High Voltage On/Off|Local: Individual push-button switches Remote: TTL compatible input. TTL high (or open) turns off high voltage output. TTL low turns on high voltage output.|
|Current Limit/Trip|Switch selectable for limit or trip. Graduated one-turn panel potentiometer is used to adjust limit or trip level from 0 to ±20 mA.|

# Out of Regulation Status Indicator and Connector

Illuminates and TTL low is provided when unit fails to produce required HV output such as during current limit.

An indicator will illuminate and a BNC will provide a TTL low when the high-voltage output is disabled due to the output current exceeding the current trip level, the detection of a high-voltage supply fault, the removal of one of the panels, or if the Trek 30/20A is out of regulation for greater than 500 ms.
