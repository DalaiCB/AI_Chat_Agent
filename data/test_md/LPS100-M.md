# ARTESYN LPS100-M SERIES

150 Watts

Advanced Energy's Artesyn LPS100-M series of open-frame AC-DC power supply features ITE and medical safety approvals. The series offers a choice of six single output models, with voltages of 5 V, 12 V, 15 V, 24 V, 48 V or 54 V. Each model also provides an isolated 12 V fan output. The main output of the 54 V model features POE (Power over Ethernet) isolation. LPS100-M series power supplies have a typical full load power conversion efficiency of 88% and with a height of only 1.29 inches offer a power density in excess of 14 watts per cubic inch. The series is primarily designed for use in information technology equipment (ITE) and light industrial systems, as well as for equipment intended for non-patient contact and non-patient critical use in low power medical, dental and laboratory applications.
