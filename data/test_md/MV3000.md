# HITEK POWER MV3000 SERIES

ELECTRICAL SPECIFICATIONS

|Output Power|3 kW at max output voltage and current|
|---|---|
|Output Voltage|100 to 300 V|
|Output Current|10 to 30 A depending on output voltage|
|Input Voltage|185 to 255 VAC 47 to 63 Hz single phase plus protective earth, operation below 185 VAC is possible with power derating down to 1500 W at 85 VAC|
|Input Current|Not exceeding 19 ARMS, harmonics are controlled with active power factor correction|
|Polarity|All models provide positive polarity. The output can be isolated from the chassis to provide negative outputs if required. Control signals are referenced to the negative output.|
|Output Ripple|Voltage mode: < 0.1% peak to peak of rated output voltage +50 mV peak to peak Current Mode: < 0.2% peak to peak of rated output current +50 mA peak to peak|
|Line Regulation|< 0.05% deviation in output voltage set point for a 10% change in supply line voltage|
|Load Regulation|Current mode: < 0.1% deviation in output current set point for a 0 to 100% change in output voltage Voltage mode: < 0.1% deviation in output voltage set point for a 0 to 100% change in load current|
|Transient Response|Response for a 10% to 90% or 90% to 10% step change in load. Overshoot/undershoot < 2% of rated output. Recovery to within 0.1% of rated output < 10 ms.|
|Temperature Coefficient|100 ppm/°C|
|Drift|< 0.5% per 8 h after 1 h warmup|

Protection
Over temperature Output overvoltage (tracking demand available) Output overcurrent (tracking demand available) Fan failure Input undervoltage

|Operating Temperature|0 to +40°C (32°F to 140°F) ambient and air intake|
|---|---|
|Storage Temperature|-20 to +85°C (-4°F to 185°F)|
|Humidity|80% max relative humidity up to 31ºC, decreasing linearly to 50% at 40°C|
|Altitude|Sea level to 2000 m (6500')|
|Usage|Indoor use only|
|Installation Category|II (BSEN 61010)|
|Pollution Degree|2 (BSEN 61010)|

|Metering|Provided as part of an alphanumeric display. Voltage meter reads 0 V to full output; resolution is < 0.5% of rated output. Current meter reads 0 A to full output; resolution is < 1.5% of rated output. Set point voltage (current) is displayed when the voltage (current) control knob is depressed.|
|---|---|
|Status Indication|If a trip occurs, the V and A information will be overwritten by the cause of the trip which may be one of:- ‘OVER VOLTAGE’, ‘OVER TEMPERATURE’, ‘OVER CURRENT, ’USER I/L OPEN’, or ‘LOOP CONTROL’. In addition the trip LED will illuminate.|
|Cooling|Fan assisted with fan fail detection. Air inlets at the front of the unit, exhaust on the rear. Min air flow inlet rate is 3 ms-1. For shelf mounting a 25 mm gap must be provided at the front and rear of the unit for air exhaust. No gap above or below the unit is necessary.|
