# HITEK POWER OLS10KD SERIES

10 KW HIGH VOLTAGE POWER SUPPLY

The HiTek Power OLS10KD series high voltage power supplies recognize the requirement for high stability and very low ripple over a wide range of output voltages.

This is achieved by combining the high power, 10 kW supply with a low power, 1 kW supply in the same chassis. The outputs of these are coupled together so that either can be used. For high voltages, usually above 10% of the maximum, the High Energy (HE) supply is used; for voltages below 10% the Low Energy (LE) supply is used. The LE supply has superior ripple and regulation at the lower voltages and maintains this down to a few hundred Volts or less.

The OLS10KD series meets the exacting requirements found in electron and ion beam systems, ion implantation and X-ray systems. There are three different input voltage variants available to order, the OLS10KD (208 VAC), the OLS10KDC (380 VAC) and the OLS10KDE (400 VAC). Designed using the latest power switching IGBTs to ensure efficient and reliable operation over the full operating range, the OLS10KD will give exemplary performance in the most severe of electrical environments. The OLS10KD achieves an exceptionally high packing density for high voltage power supplies of this power level, giving 169 W/Litre, 2.7 W/inch3. The 6U construction allows operation at full power when close-mounted in a standard equipment rack, giving significant savings in rack space in large systems. Many components are common between the HE and LE supplies, minimising the space required for the dual configuration. Featuring a unique Arc Count and Extinguish (ACE) system for managing systems where load arcing is endemic, the OLS10KD protects both itself and the load from damage that may be caused by excessive arcing whilst allowing normal operation to continue.

|Arc Count and Extinguish (ACE)|Each time the ACE system detects an arc it blanks the supply off for a brief period to extinguish the arc. The unit is then allowed to recover. If more arcs occur they are counted to determine the arc rate; if this exceeds a safe level the power supply is shut down. The parameters are factory set to 25 arcs in any 5 second period.|

|Cooling|The OLS10KD utilizes forced forced air cooling. Air is drawn in via the front panel louvered opening and through side panel vents. Ensure that within the rack there is a free air opening with a minimum effective area of 195 cm2 directly in front of the unit front panel louvre. An additional free air opening with a minimum effective area of 195 cm2 is required for the side vents. Air flow from this additional free air opening to the side vents of the power converter must not be restricted. The expected air flow for each opening is approximately 50 Litres per second. The maximum temperature of the air entering the unit must not exceed 40°C. The unit can dissipate up to 2 kW, therefore provision must be made to extract the exhaust air from the rack in order to prevent possible overheating.|
