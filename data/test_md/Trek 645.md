TREK 645

Software-driven electrostatic chuck supply offers an array of features that provide significant benefits while accommodating a variety of demanding applications.

The Trek® 645 software-driven electrostatic chuck supply with documented use that shows customers have seen increases in efficiency and throughput equal to three times that of other supplies. The Trek 645 virtually eliminates sticky wafer and wafer popping issues, thus ensuring better control over particle contamination. Given the versatility and performance of the Trek 645, it can be used in multiple unique tools/processes, thus eliminating the need to specify a new supply for each unique tool/process in a facility.

# TREK 645 ELECTROSTATIC CHUCK SUPPLY

# TECHNICAL DATA

|Outputs| |
|---|---|
|Simultaneous High Voltage Outputs|Two simultaneous high-voltage outputs (Output Phase A and Output Phase B) of equal magnitude and opposite in polarity relative to an offset voltage|
|Output Phasing|Output Voltage A: 0 to ±2 kV (Reference Phase) Output Voltage B: 0 to ±2 kV (Phase B =[-1] x Phase A) Offset Voltage: An offset voltage of up to ±2 kV may be simultaneously added to the output of each phase. When an offset voltage is added, the polarity and magnitude of offset voltage appears simultaneously on both outputs A and B regardless of the magnitude and polarity of the A and B voltages themselves. The sum of the offset voltage and the output voltage of each phase cannot exceed ±2 kV|
|Output Waveshape|Each DC output voltage (Phase A and Phase B) is ramped up and down with symmetrical rise and fall times, or can be programmed with the user’s custom clamping and declamping waveforms|
|Output Voltage Range|0 to ±2 kVDC, maximum|
|Output Current|0 to ±6.5 mADC with peak capability of 10 mA|

|Input| |
|---|---|
|Setting the High Voltage Amplitude|HV magnitude can be controlled either externally or internally to the unit|

# TECHNICAL DATA

|Environmental Specifications| |
|---|---|
|Temperature|0 to 35°C (32 to 104°F)|
|Relative Humidity|Up to 85%, non-condensing|
|Altitude|Up to 2000 m (6561.68 ft)|

Features:

- Interlock: Connections are provided to support an interlock safety configuration. In the event that the interlock is open, the high-voltage generation circuits are shut down.
- Digital Display: 40 x 2 LCD character display shows various system functions such as Set Voltage, Output Voltage, and Capacitance Monitor.
- Clamped Wafer Detection Feature: To indicate wafer clamping events, the capacitive currents generated by a low voltage sine wave, super-imposed on the Phase A and Phase B outputs, are monitored but can be disabled through the program. The superimposed waveform is used to indicate a no wafer, wafer present, or wafer clamped status (Thresholds are set by the program).
- Capacitive Load Select: Clamped capacitance status range can be selected by the program for 0 to 10, 20, or 30nF (phase to phase) depending on the system and electrostatic clamp physical configurations.
