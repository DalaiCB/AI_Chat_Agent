# TREK 50/12

High voltage power amplifier with an all-solid-state design for high slew rate, wide bandwidth, and low-noise operation.

The Trek® 50/12 is a DC-stable, high-voltage power amplifier featuring an all solid-state design for high slew rate, wide bandwidth, and low-noise operation. It is designed to provide precise control of output voltages in the range of 0 to ±50 kV DC or peak AC with an output current range of 0 to ±12 mA DC or peak AC. The four-quadrant, active output stage sinks or sources current to reactive or resistive loads throughout the output voltage range. This is essential to achieve the accurate output response and high slew rates demanded by reactive loads.

# TECHNICAL DATA

|Environmental Specifications| |
|---|---|
|Temperature|0 to 40°C (32 to 104°F)|
|Relative Humidity|To 75%, noncondensing|
|Altitude|To 1524 meters (5000 ft)|

# Features

- High Voltage On/Off
- Dynamic Adjustment
- Current Limit/Trip
- Out of Regulation Status Indicator and Connector

Local: Individual push-button switches

Remote: TTL compatible input. TTL high (or open) turns off high voltage output. TTL low turns on high voltage output.

Graduated one-turn panel potentiometer is used to optimize the AC response for various load parameters.

Switch selectable for limit or trip. Graduated one-turn panel potentiometer is used to adjust limit or trip level from 0 to ±12 mA.

Illuminates and TTL low is provided when unit fails to produce required HV output such as during current limit.

An indicator will illuminate and a BNC will provide a TTL low when the high-voltage output is disabled due to the output current exceeding the current trip level, the detection of a high-voltage supply fault, the removal of one of the panels, or if the Trek 50/12 is out of regulation for greater than 500 ms.
