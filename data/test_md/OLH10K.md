The HiTek Power® OLH10K Series is a range of high reliability single output high voltage power supplies designed to meet the rigorous requirements of ion and electron beam systems, ion implantation, and X-ray equipment.

The systems consist of two units: a rack mounting power converter through which both local and remote controls can be facilitated, and a separate HV unit employing a modular disc construction. Numerous features are incorporated to ensure system integrity is maintained during adverse operating conditions, including Advanced Energy's unique Arc Count and Extinguish (ACE) system for managing systems where load arcing is endemic.

|Polarity|Positive or negative to order|
|Minimum Voltage|5% of rated output voltage. The unit may be turned down below this but the specifications are not guaranteed below this level.|
|Calibration|Calibration between Voltage Demand, Output Voltage and Voltage Monitor ±0.2% of setting or ±0.05% of rating, whichever is greater|
|Recovery Time|Less than 200 ms to within 0.1% of previous operating level following a short circuit or arc. Maximum overshoot 2% of rated output voltage|
|Temperature Coefficient|Less than 100 ppm/°C|
|Drift|Less than 0.01% per hour after 1 hour’s warm up, typically less than 0.02% per 8 hours after 1 hour’s warm up, at constant load, line and temperature|

|Protection|The units are fully protected against over voltage, over current, over temperature, load arcing and output short circuits.|
|Arc Count and Extinguish (ACE)|Each time the ACE system detects an arc it blanks the supply off for a brief period to extinguish the arc. The unit is then allowed to recover. If more arcs occur they are counted to determine the arc rate; if this exceeds a safe level the power supply is shut down. The parameters are factory set to 25 arcs in any 5 second period.|

|Voltage Ripple|
|---|
|Voltage Mode|Less than 0.1% of rated voltage +2 V, peak to peak or less than 0.02% of rated voltage +1 V, rms|
|Current Mode|Less than 0.5% of rated voltage peak to peak or less than 0.1% of rated voltage rms|

|Voltage Regulation|
|---|
|Line|Less than 0.01% +0.5 V change in output voltage for a 10% change in line voltage|
|Load|Less than 0.01% +0.5 V change in output voltage for 0 to 100% change in load current|

|Current Regulation|
|---|
|Line|Less than 0.5% of rated current for a ±10% change in line voltage|
|Load|Less than 0.5% of rated current for 0 to 100% change in output voltage|

|Cooling|
|---|
|Converter|The unit utilizes forced air cooling. Air is drawn in via the front panel slotted opening and through side panel vents. Ensure that within the rack there is a free air opening with a minimum effective area of 195cm2 directly in front of the unit front panel slots. An additional free air opening with a minimum effective area of 195m2 is required for the side vents. Air flow from this additional free air opening to the side vents of the power converter must not be restricted. The expected air flow for each opening is approximately 50 Litres per second. The maximum temperature of the air entering the units must not exceed 40°C (104°F).|
|HV Unit|The HV Unit may be mounted in any orientation, but at least 150 mm of free space should be allowed around the HV base for air intake/exhaust from the fans. The side panel grilles must not be obstructed. The maximum temperature of air entering the HV base must not exceed 40°C (104°F). Adequate clearance must be allowed around the HV discs to take account of the high voltage output. The HV unit can dissipate up to 1 kW, therefore provision must be made to extract air/cool the oil in the HV enclosure in order to prevent possible overheating.|

1 The Series OLH10K is intended for installation as a component of a system and is designed to meet. The unit will not trip and recovers to normal operation after a disturbance as defined in SEMI F47-0706. The EMC performance of the power supply can only be fully assessed when installed within, and as part of, the final system.
