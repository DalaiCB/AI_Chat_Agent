MIKRON M305

Compact, general purpose blackbody calibration source for medium temperatures of 100 to 1000°C (212 to 1832°F). 5040

The Mikron® M305 blackbody calibration source uniquely combines portability with wide temperature range, high emissivity, and high accuracy. It is an ideal calibration unit where portability is required or where installation space is limited. Its spherical metal cavity design yields an emissivity of 0.995 over the temperature range of 100 to 1000°C (212 to 1832°F) with an aperture of 25 mm (1”). An integrally mounted PID controller adds to the unique versatility of this calibrator.

# OVERVIEW

Blackbody calibration sources are infrared radiators used for calibrating and verifying the output signals of infrared thermometers (pyrometers), thermal imaging systems, heat flux measurement systems, or spectrographic analysis systems. Advanced Energy supplies a unique selection of very precise calibration sources that are traceable to national standards. Quotations for custom designs and variations are available upon request.

Mikron calibration sources are superior because of the emissivity values, homogeneous emission areas, and a wide range of different sized apertures to adapt to the desired target area. In addition, fast heat-up times and high temperature stability are guaranteed. The quality of our calibration sources is guaranteed by tests, burn-in times, and radiometric calibrations. On most models, a certificate is provided to document the traceability to the international temperature scale ITS90 and NIST.
