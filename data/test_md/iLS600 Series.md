# iLS600 and iLS600-R SERIES

iLS600 and iLS600-R SERIES 600W LXI CERTIFIED PROGRAMMABLE POWER SUPPLIES (CONTINUED)

Notes

1. Minimum voltage is guaranteed at greater than 1% of the rated output voltage. Minimum current is guaranteed at greater than 1% of the rated output current.
2. Measured with 20 MHz bandwidth and excluding line frequency ripple (see application note AN024 for measurement details).
3. Time for output voltage to recover within 0.5% of its rated output for a load change from 10 to 90% of its rated output current. Voltage set point from 10% to 100% of rated output.
4. Add this to the output reopens time to obtain the total programming time.
5. Time to provide data back to the controller using LAN interface (does not include A/D conversion time).
6. iLS600-R series come with rear ports.

* Supplemental characteristics are not warranted but are descriptions of typical performance determined either by design or type testing.

Rotary Controls

The digital rotary controls allow both fine and rapid adjustment of the output voltage and current. They are velocity sensitive so that a slow turn allows fine adjustment of voltage or current and rapid turning quickly adjusts voltage or current over a large range.

Precise voltage and current measurement

Besides the precise output, the PLS600 series also offers the capability to measure voltage & current accurately (read back), saving users the extra expense and space for extra measuring instruments. This capability is available from the display or the readings may be read into the controlling device.

OVP (over voltage protection), OCP (over current protection) and OPP (over power protection) functions

The over voltage protection (OVP), over current protection (OCP) and over power protection (OPP) features limit the maximum output current and voltage to avoid damage to the unit under test (UUT).

Series and parallel capability

Up to 4 units can be connected in (main/satellite mode) and up to 2 units can be connected in series.
