# ANDROS 6511

OEM gas analyzer for greenhouse gas detection and monitoring.

The Andros® 6511 OEM gas module achieves high reliability through simplicity of design and implementation. Andros Non-Dispersive Infrared (NDIR) gas modules are inherently reliable because there are no moving parts in the optical path. Unlike alternative analyzers that require motors, gratings, chopper wheels, and/or other moving components with limited useful lives, Andros gas analyzers use a pulsed infrared source to achieve high accuracy with high reliability. Unlike other infrared analyzers, Andros non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) gas analyzers measure multiple gases in an instrument with a single optical path platform. Single-gas analyzers are inadequate when using methane as a biofuel because the gas often contains large amounts of CO2 as a contaminant. Andros analyzers have the ability to measure CO2, CO, and O2 in addition to methane and therefore provide the optimal combination of gases for combustion optimization.

# PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS

- Measure up to five gases: three via NDIR and two via plug-in sensors
- RS232 or USB1 outputs
- Fast response times
- User-selectable reporting: Either propane for non-methane fuels or methane

# OVERVIEW

Who Will Benefit from Methane Measurement?

- Landfill operators that burn methane in flares, power generators, and boilers.
- Industrial operators of methane fueled boilers, furnaces, and incinerators.
- Agricultural methane capture for local use or transfer to pipelines.

2.145 The 6511 has a very wide dynamic range: CO2 up to 20%, Methane up to 100% and CO up to 20%. This wide dynamic measurement range with real-time temperature and pressure compensation provides the capability to monitor anaerobic digestion processes and control of these processes to maximize methane production. Adding an optional oxygen measurement provides the capability to monitor the combustion efficiency of equipment that uses biogas as a fuel.

5.130 Necessary Features for Methane Applications

- Temperature and pressure data available for use in calculating pounds per hour of CH4 and CO2.
- Two electrochemical sensor inputs for a total of five gases from a single instrument.

# DIMENSIONS

Extensive Calibration For High Accuracy

Every Andros NDIR analyzer is individually calibrated at four separate temperatures between 0 and 50°C. At each of the four temperatures, the gas channels are profiled with up to 20 separate gas concentrations. The results of this extensive calibration process are stored within each system resulting in the most accurate analysis possible. This attention to detail provides a highly accurate and stable factory calibration of the NDIR analyzer. Our factory calibration is so accurate and stable that many of our customers have chosen to never re-calibrate their Andros analyzers. This type of calibration allows for wide dynamic measurement ranges that can permit field spanning in the measurement range of interest.

# ANDROS 6500 AND ANDROS 6520

High-performance OEM gas analyzers for vehicle diagnostics, inspection, and maintenance.

The Andros® 6500 and 6520 OEM gas modules achieve high reliability through simplicity of design and implementation. Andros Non-Dispersive Infrared (NDIR) gas modules are inherently reliable because there are no moving parts in the optical path. Unlike alternative analyzers that require motors, gratings, chopper wheels, and/or other moving components with limited useful lives, Andros gas analyzers use a pulsed infrared source to achieve high accuracy with high reliability. The system measures gases, communicates with the host via RS232 or USB, and allows user-defined TTL outputs, as well as analog and tachometer inputs which can be integrated into the data output stream for user convenience.

# ANDROS 6500

- Measure up to five gases: three via NDIR and two via plug-in sensors
- RS232 or USB outputs
- DC pump and solenoid valve drivers
- Two analog-to-digital inputs
- Differential pressure transducer for low flow/leak detection

# OVERVIEW

Highly Accurate Calibration

Each 6500 series system is individually calibrated for operation from 0 to 50°C over the entire range of specified concentrations. The results of this intensive calibration process are stored within each system, providing the most accurate analysis possible. This attention to detail provides a highly accurate factory calibration of the NDIR analyzer. In fact, this factory calibration is so accurate and stable that many of our customers have chosen to never re-calibrate their Andros analyzers.

The Andros 6500 is designed to meet and exceed both ISO 3930/OIML R99, Class 0, and BAR 97 specifications.

High Stability: Rapid Warm-Up

The enhanced optics and electronics of the 6500 has virtually eliminated zero drift. Prior to this breakthrough, frequent zeroing of an analyzer was required during the first half-hour of operation for sensitive measurements. Now, with just two “zeroes” during the first three minutes, the 6500 meets all accuracy specifications.

For Current Andros Customers: A Painless Upgrade

Now it will be easy to keep older BAR 90 and OIML Class 1 equipment up to-date with the new BAR 97, ISO3930/OIML R99, Class 0 certified Andros 6500. Simply install the Andros 6500 into your existing Andros based equipment.

The 6500 not only serves as a drop in replacement for the Model 6602, but with minor mounting modifications, it can replace any of the Model 62XX product line.

No need to scrap old software and hardware when only the NDIR system needs replacing. (While the connectors and software are identical to the older systems, it is possible that a change in wiring lengths or routing may be required depending on your original design).

Unique Optical Architecture

The optics of the 6500 series incorporates precision beam focusing architecture. A concentrated infrared beam generated from a proprietary emitter passes through a precision lens into a cleanable or replaceable gold-lined sample cell that the gas of interest is flowing through. The beam then passes into an optical assembly of highly specialized filters and a unique multi-element detector.

Comprehensive Software Architecture

Embedded dual protocol software makes upgrading older products utilizing models 6230, 6231, 6241, 6231A, or 6241A easy.

All calculations are performed in real-time for transmission to your host system. Control of key system devices such as gas flow solenoids and a sampling pump is provided with the ability to accept commands from the host.
