# MAXSTREAM 300 LOW FLOW CHAMBER CLEAN REMOTE PLASMA SOURCE

The MAXstreamTM 300 is a compact, reliable, and cost-effective remote plasma source (RPS) solution for low flow (2 to 3 SLPM) NF3 chamber clean applications. The MAXstream 300 is 18% smaller than the Xstream RPS unit to save valuable tool space and offers drop-in compatibility with traditional RPS tools, allowing customers an easy upgrade path to improved performance and reliability. Market leading power control for improved process repeatability along with AE’s proprietary aluminum (Al) substrate with Type 3 hard anodization combine to make it one of the most consistent and reliable RPS units on the market.

# PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS

- Compact, low cost-of-ownership solution for 2 to 3 SLPM chamber cleaning processes
- Industry-leading power control for consistent, repeatable performance
- Proprietary high-purity Al substrate with Type 3 anodization for longer chamber life
- Unique dual ignition core design ensures virtually 100% ignition reliability
- Drop-in compatibility with traditional RPS systems to enable simple design-in compatibility as well as seamless field upgrades to a reliable, repeatable, and low cost-of-ownership solution
