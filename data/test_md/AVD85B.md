# ARTESYN AVD85B SERIES

85 Watt 1/16” brick DC/DC Converter

Advanced Energy's Artesyn AVD85B series sixteenth-brick isolated DC-DC converter provides a fully regulated single output at 5V or 12V that is capable of delivering up to 85Watts. It has a wide 2:1 input range of 36 to 75 Vdc and is designed primarily for use with standard 48 V telecommunications equipment supplies. Rated at 85 watts, the converter employs an open-frame construction, offers up to 93% efficiency and accommodates an ambient operating temperature range of -40 to 85˚C. A baseplate option is available for enhanced thermal performance. SMT bullet pin with reel tape package is available for reflow processing. The converter uses fixed frequency switching to minimize the need for external EMI filtering.
