# TECHNICAL DATA (CONTINUED)

Features (Continued)

|Float Mode, (+) Decay|Performs float voltage and decay time EOS/ESD measurements utilizing parameters, guidelines, and standards set by the EOS/ESD Association|
|---|---|
|(-) Decay Mode|For (+) Decay and (-) Decay Modes, the ion collecting plate is charged to a voltage level above the programmed (+) or (-) start voltage value. The plate is allowed to decay toward zero due to the ion impingement on the plate. The time required for the plate to decay from the programmed start voltage to the programmed stop voltage is displayed on the timer.|
|Float Mode|The charged plate monitor is reset to 0 V ±0.5 V. The plate is allowed to “float” to a voltage level dictated by ion impingement on the plate.|
|USB Flash Drive USB Host|USB host port allows information to be saved, retrieved, and exchanged.|
