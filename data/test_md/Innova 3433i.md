# INNOVA 3433i

OVERVIEW

Gas selectivity for the Innova 3433i monitor is achieved through the use of optical filters. By installing up to five filters, the 3433i can measure the concentration of up to five component gases and water vapor in any air sample. The detection limit is gas-dependent, but is typically in the ppb region.

The monitoring system is easily operated through either the front panel, with its push-buttons and display providing short explanatory texts, or through the PC software. Both methods allow the user to configure the monitor, start a measurement sequence, and view the resulting concentration values of specific gases.

Reliability is ensured by a series of self tests performed by the monitor. The self tests check software, data integrity, and the 3433i’s components to ensure that they function properly. If a fault is found, it is reported in the measurement results, so that the integrity of the results can be ensured.

The 3433i measurement system requires no consumables and very little regular maintenance. For most applications, recalibration is only necessary one to two times a year.

# MEASURING DETAILS

Selectivity

The gas selectivity of the 3433i is determined by the optical filters installed in its filter wheel. Because water is nearly always present in ambient air and absorbs infrared light at most wavelengths, it contributes to the total acoustic signal in the analysis cell. Therefore, the monitor is permanently fitted with a special filter that measures water vapor and enables the 3433i to compensate for water vapor interference. By selecting different filters, this technique can also be used to cross-compensate for known interferent gases.

Calibration

After the relevant optical filters are installed, the monitor must be calibrated. This is achieved through easy-to-use menu driven instructions. Thanks to its high stability, calibration of the 3433i is seldom necessary more than once a year. Calibration is performed using either the Calibration Software BZ7002 or directly from the 3433i's front panel.

Operation

The 3433i monitoring system is easy to operate using either the application software or by using the front panel push-keys (which can be locked and accessed at three levels using passwords). The monitor can be operated as both an online and offline instrument (i.e. standalone operation). Using these user-interfaces with their logical division of information, everything that needs to be defined is achieved prior to starting the monitoring task.

Configuring the Monitor

The set-up option enables all the parameters necessary to complete the monitoring task to be defined. This includes setting the Sample Integration Times (S.I.T.) option, which enables measurement results to be weighted - sensitivity against speed.

Starting Measurements

Once the set-up parameters have been defined, measurements can be started immediately or later using a delayed start time. Once started, the monitoring task continues until it is stopped either manually or by using a defined stop time.

Measurement Cycle

|1.|The pump draws air from the sampling point through the air filter to flush out the “old” air in the measurement system and replace it with a “new” air sample. The pressure sensor is used to check that the pump sequence is elapsed successfully and to measure the actual air pressure.|
|---|---|
|2.|The “new” air sample is hermetically sealed In the analyses cell by closing the inlet and outlet valves.|
|3.|Light from an infrared light source is reflected off a mirror, passed through a mechanical chopper, which pulsates it, and then through one of the optical filters in the filter wheel.|
|4.|The gas being monitored selectively absorbs the light transmitted by the optical filter. Because the light is pulsating, the gas temperature increases and decreases, causing an equivalent increase and decrease in the pressure of the gas (an acoustic signal) in the closed cell.|
|5.|Two microphones mounted in the cell wall measure this acoustic signal, which is directly proportional to the concentration of the monitored gas present in the cell.|
|6.|The filter wheel turns so that light is transmitted through the next optical filter, and the new signal is measured. The number of times this step is repeated is dependent on the number of gases being measured.|
|7.|The response time is approximately 13 seconds for one gas or water vapor, or approximately 26 seconds if five gases and water vapor are measured.|

Online Measurement Results

Using the monitor’s standard interface, measurement results are transferred directly to a PC or integrated into the process system.

Maintenance

The only maintenance tasks necessary are calibration and replacement of the air filter. Both tasks are easily performed. The frequency for changing the air filter depends on the individual applications.
