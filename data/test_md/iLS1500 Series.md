Advanced Energy’s Artesyn iLS1500 series is a programmable DC power supply with a single 1500 Watt output. With 12-bit D/A & A/D converters embedded, the power supplies come with the capability of reporting voltage and current very accurately. The iLS1500 series provides convenient dynamic rotary controls for voltage and current adjustment. The power supplies also come with rear ports that allow remote control via USB, Ethernet, and analog control inputs and they are designed to offer either bench use or rack mounting. The iLS1500 series is LXI certified, details for using this interface can be found in our Programming Manual.

Notes

1. Rating is percent of full scale. Rating is for operation between 10% of minimum voltage or current rating to 100% of voltage rating and the current rating at that voltage. Minimum voltage is guaranteed at greater than 1% of the rated output voltage. Minimum current is guaranteed at greater than 1% of the rated output current.
2. Measured with 20 MHz bandwidth and excluding line frequency ripple (see application note AN024 for measurement details).
3. Time for output voltage to recover within 0.5% of its rated output for a load change from 10 to 90% of its rated output current. Voltage set point from 10% to 100% of rated output.
4. Add this to the output reopens time to obtain the total programming time.
5. Time to provide data back to the controller using LAN interface (does not include A/D conversion time).
6. 1500 Watt Output is only available with an AC input of 110 VAC or greater. With a lower AC line, output will be limited to 1100 Watts.

* Supplemental characteristics are not warranted but are descriptions of typical performance determined either by design or type testing. Specifications subject to change without notice. Contact Versatile Power for full specifications and additional information.
