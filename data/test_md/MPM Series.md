# ULTRAVOLT MPM 100 TO 500 SERIES

The MPM series’ high voltage output varies proportionately with input voltage. An optional interface isolates input from high voltage output, up to a maximum of 100 VDC. The shield — which helps protect the module from external radiated emissions — should be connected to ground.

# Standard Interface (Non-isolated)

|Pin|Label|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Gnd|Ground|DC Input Power Ground, High Voltage Return|
|2|Vin|Input|DC Input Power|
|3|HVout|Output|High Voltage Output|
|Shield| |Ground|Shield Ground|

# Isolated Interface (I Option, 100 VDC Max)

|Pin|Label|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Gnd|Ground|DC Input Power Ground|
|2|Vin|Input|DC Input Power|
|3|HVout|Output|High Voltage Output|
|4|HVret|Ground|High Voltage Return|
|Shield| |Ground|Shield Ground|

For proper operation and safety, always route HVret signal through HVret connection.

# STANDARD OPTIONS

The MPM series can be factory configured with several standard options that adapt its performance to specialized application requirements.

|Option|Description|
|---|---|
|S|Six-sided shielded case consisting of tin-plated metal case and mating PCB that provides additional protection from external radiated emissions.|
|I|Isolation up to 100 VDC maximum between input and high voltage output. Permits use of an external resistor between HVret and ground to sense current, or an external capacitor to reduce common mode ripple.|
