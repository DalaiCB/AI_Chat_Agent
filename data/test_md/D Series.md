# ULTRAVOLT D SERIES MICRO-SIZED HIGH VOLTAGE BIASING SUPPLIES

The UltraVolt© D series of high voltage power supplies is designed to meet the needs of customers with low-profile, < 13 mm (< 0.511") or < 17.5 mm (< 0.689") applications at 1 to 6 W. These ultra-compact modules are ideal for detectors that require high-bias voltages and currents at low ripple. D series PCB-mount high voltage power supplies feature a lightweight design, state-of-the-art surface-mount technology, and five-sided metal enclosures.
