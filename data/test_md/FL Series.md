# ULTRAVOLT FL SERIES

FLOATING HOT DECK LVPS WITH ISOLATED DIGITAL AND ANALOG I/O

The UltraVolt® FL series of floating-hot-deck, low-voltage power supplies offers an integrated solution for systems requiring LV power & controls with high-voltage isolation. Combining a highly isolated, DC-to-DC, multi-output low-voltage power supply (LVPS) with an advanced isolated digital & analog I/O topology, the FL sub-system provides both power and controls to floating-hot-deck circuitry. This solution, when combined with one or more UV HVPS or other circuitry, can provide high-performance solutions.
