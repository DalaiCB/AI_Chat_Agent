# ARTESYN SIL05E Series

Non-Isolated DC-DC Converters

Advanced Energy's Artesyn SIL05E series are non-isolated dc-dc converters packaged in a single-in-line footprint giving designers a cost-effective solution for conversion from a 3.3 - 5 Vin source. The SIL05E has a wide input range (3.0 - 5.5 Vdc) and offers a wide 0.75 - 3.63 Vdc output voltage range with a 5 A load, which allows for maximum design flexibility and a pathway for future upgrades. The SIL05E is designed for applications that include distributed power, workstations, optical network, and wireless applications. Implemented using state-of-the-art automated manufacturing techniques, the SIL05E offers compact size and efficiencies of up to 94%.

|SIL = Single In Line|05 = 5 Amps|E = Enhanced Performance|05 = 3.0 - 5.5 Vdc|W = Wide|0.75 - 3.63 Vdc|V = Vertical, H = Horizontal, J = Pb-free (RoHS 6/6 compliant)|

# OUTPUT VOLTAGE ADJUSTMENT

The ultra-wide output voltage trim range offers major advantages to users who select the SIL05E-05W3V3. It is no longer necessary to purchase a variety of modules in order to cover different output voltages. The output voltage can be trimmed in a range of 0.75 to 3.63 Vdc.

When the SIL05E-05W3V3 converter leaves the factory, the output has been adjusted to the default voltage of 0.75 V.

- When Vin >4.5 V, then Vout can be adjusted from 0.75 - 3.63 Vdc
- When Vin <4.5 V, then Vout can be adjusted from 0.75 - 2.75 Vdc

Notes:

1. The SIL05E features a ‘Negative Logic’ Remote ON/OFF operation. If not using the Remote ON/OFF pin, leave the pin open (the converter will be on). The Remote ON/OFF pin is referenced to ground. The following conditions apply for the SIL05E:
- Remote pin open circuit - Unit is ON
- Remote pin pulled low - Unit is ON
- Remote pin pulled high [Von/off > 2.5 V] - Unit is OFF

A ‘Positive Logic’ Remote ON/OFF version is also possible with this converter. To order please use part number SIL05E-05W3V3-VRJ.
2. Full derating curves available in both the Longform (Technical Reference) and Application Note.
3. For horizontal mounting option, please consult factory for details.
4. NOTICE: Some models do not support all options. Please contact your local Advanced Energy’s Artesyn representative or use the on-line model number search tool at http://www.artesyn.com to find a suitable alternative.
