TREK 601C

High voltage power amplifier with an all-solid-state design for high slew rate, wide bandwidth, and low-noise operation.

The Trek® 601C is a DC-stable, high voltage power amplifier designed to provide precise control of output voltages. It features up to two independent amplifier channels in one enclosure and an all solid-state design for high slew rate, wide bandwidth and low-noise operation. The four-quadrant, active output design of the Trek 601C sinks or sources current into reactive or resistive loads. These features are essential for achieving the accurate output response and high slew rates demanded by reactive loads.
