Advanced Energy's Artesyn NPS40-M series of open-frame AC-DC power supplies comprises five single output models, offering voltages of 5 V, 12 V, 15 V, 24 V or 48 V. All five models feature ITE and medical safety approvals and are equipped with dual AC fuses. The power supplies have a typical full load efficiency of 87% and a no-load power consumption of less than 300 mW. NPS40-M series power supplies are primarily designed for use in information technology equipment (ITE) and light industrial systems, as well as for equipment intended for non-patient contact and non-patient critical use in low power medical, dental and laboratory applications.
