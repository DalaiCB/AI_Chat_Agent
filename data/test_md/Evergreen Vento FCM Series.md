# EVERGREEN™ VENTO™ FCM10K 10,000 W Bulk Front End

Advanced Energy’s FCM10K series provides for three phase three wire of AC-DC embedded power requirements. Featuring high build quality with robust screw terminals, long life, and typical full-load efficiency of greater than 96.3%, reaching a peak of 97%, these units are ideal for use in industrial applications. They are backed by a comprehensive set of industrial safety approvals and certificates. Variable-speed “smart fans” draw on software controls developed by Advanced Energy to match fan speed to the unit’s cooling requirement and load current. Slowing the fan not only saves power but also reduces wear, thus extending its life.
