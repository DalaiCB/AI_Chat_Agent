# Luxtron M-1000 FluorOptic Temperature Converter

OVERVIEW

The complete Luxtron M-1000 series system consists of the electronics module assembly plus probes. The probes are often custom developed. The system uses FluorOptic® technology, based on a temperature sensitive phosphorescent sensor attached to the end of an optical fiber.

The M-1000 use the principles of phosphorescence to provide a wide measurement temperature range with high-accuracy temperature monitoring for critical semiconductor applications.

Custom OEM probe design and quick-turn prototypes are offered by Advanced Energy’s experienced engineering team. These probes are designed to provide accurate and repeatable process temperature measurement while still being easy to install into the OEM’s equipment.

With the AccuDisc™ option, “non-contact” temperature measurement becomes possible by bonding the low-mass AccuDisc sensor to the object and remotely measuring with a non-contact optical probe. This substantially reduces the thermal offset and enables stable thermal contact even as equipment experiences thermal expansion and contraction, which leads to better accuracy and repeatability of the temperature measurement.
