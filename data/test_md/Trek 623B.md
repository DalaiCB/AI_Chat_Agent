TREK 623B

High voltage power amplifier provides precise control of bi-polar output voltages using an all solid-state design for a high slew rate, wide bandwidth, and low-noise operation.

The Trek® 623B is a DC-stable, high voltage power amplifier designed to provide precise control of bi-polar output voltages. It features an all-solid-state design for high slew rate, low-noise operation and a wide bandwidth of DC to greater than 10 kHz. The four-quadrant, active output stage sinks or sources current into reactive or resistive loads throughout the output voltage range. This type of output is essential to achieve an accurate output response and high slew rate demanded by a variety of loads such as highly capacitive or reactive loads.
