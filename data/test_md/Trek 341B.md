TREK 341B

High-speed, high voltage electrostatic voltmeter for non-contact surface voltage measurements using a field-nulling technique for DC stability and high accuracy.

The Trek® 341B is a DC-stable, precision electrostatic voltmeter for making non-contacting surface voltage measurements. The Trek 341B employs a field-nulling technique that achieves DC stability and high accuracy even if the probe-to-surface spacing changes. This permits measurements of either stationary or moving surfaces without the need to establish fixed spacing to maintain accuracy. The instrument also utilizes a patented probe design that eliminates the need for close tolerance components which significantly improves noise and drift under conditions of high humidity and wide temperature ranges.

# PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS
