# IMPAC IGA 315-K

Portable digital pyrometers for non-contact temperature measurement of nozzle bricks and air stages in coking ovens between 600 and 1600°C (1112 to 2912°F).

The Impac® IGA 315-K infrared thermometers are high-quality, battery-driven portables for non-contact temperature measurement. The instruments feature a modified optical path for easily targeting the nozzle brick through a small space from the oven roof after opening the heating flue. With the high-quality focusable optics, accurate measurements can be made at distances between 1 and 12 m.

# PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS

- Rapid temperature recording of nozzle bricks and air stages in coking ovens
- Viewfinder with temperature area markings for simple aiming at the measuring point
- Double measurement temperature display on the housing and in the viewfinder
- Special measurement memory for storing measurement values in measurement series
- Focusable precision optics for adjustment to small measurement fields
- Infrared interface for transfer of measurement values to a PC
- Focusable optics with a small measuring field at large measuring distances

# OVERVIEW

The IGA 315-K portable pyrometer has been specially developed for use in coking plants.

For easy sighting, a circular measuring field is marked in the viewfinder, which represents the size of the object to be measured. The correct measuring distance is found by adjusting the focusable optics until the item under test is sharply focused. The temperature indication can be viewed directly in the viewfinder.

Using the one-button operation, the instrument can be quickly switched on, or a measurement value can be saved. The data storage can save up to 2000 measurement values, including date and time. Typically, multiple measurements are made in a certain sequence throughout the coking plant, so in order to clearly allocate each stored data value to the correct measured spot, a series of measurements can be defined ahead of time. For example, certain data points could correlate with the heating flues of an oven.

The storage configuration facilitates later evaluation, even if the data is transferred to a PC, using the included software. The data can then be both displayed graphically or imported into a spreadsheet program such as Excel.

# OPTICS

The pyrometer is equipped with high-quality focussable optics. These are adjusted to the distance of the object to be measured and therefore achieve the measuring field sizes stated as examples in the measuring field table.

The setting is made by sharply focussing the object to be measured in the viewfinder. Intermediate measuring distances or measuring field diameters can be determined by interpolation.
