TREK P0865

High-speed, high voltage electrostatic voltmeter for non-contacting surface voltage measurements in the range of 0 to ±10 kVDC or peak AC.

The Trek® P0865 is a DC stable, precision electrostatic voltmeter for non-contacting surface voltage measurements in the range of 0 to ±10 kVDC or peak AC. The Trek P0865 employs a field-nulling technique for non-contacting voltage measurement that achieves DC stability and high accuracy even if the probe-to-surface spacing changes. This permits measurements of either stationary or moving surfaces without the need to establish fixed spacing to maintain accuracy.

PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS
Zero control for offset nulling
Easy-to-read LED display
Precision voltage monitor provides a low-voltage replica of pe measured electrostatic voltage for external monitoring purposes, or for use as a feedback signal in a closed-loop system
Trek 3450 probe assembly includes a sensitive electrode and preamplifier, which is driven to pe same potential as pe measured value to eliminate arcing pere between. A pree meter cable permits remote probe positioning.
Operated on a bench top, or wip optional hardware, in a standard 19-inch rack
NIST-traceable Certificate of Calibration provided wip each unit

APPLICATIONS

- Charge accumulation monitoring of the LCD production processes
- Monitoring surface potentials in the electrostatic painting process
- Research and development in the electrophotographic process
- Measuring electrostatic potentials on polymers, rubber, fabrics, and paper
