# IMPAC IN 5 PLUS SERIES

# OVERVIEW

The IN 5 plus is a digital stationary infrared thermometer for non-contact temperature measurement on various surfaces.

The IN 5-L plus is equipped with optics with better fields of view for the measurements of small objects, while the high-speed IN 5-H plus has a shorter exposure time of only 10 ms and is suited for fast measuring tasks. For optimal match of the instrument to the application (size of the measuring object, distance) different optics are available. For a precise alignment of the pyrometers to the measuring object, the instruments are equipped with a laser targeting light.

OPTICS

The pyrometers are equipped ex works with one of the specified optics. Each optic is focused at a certain distance (main measuring distance). At these distances, each lens achieves its smallest spot size. Normally the spot size will increase at any other distance (shorter or longer).

For each optic, some example values for measuring distance (measured from the front of the lens) and spot size are listed in the table. Keep this in mind when considering the mounting position of the pyrometer as well as the size of the measuring object (the measuring object must be at least as big as the spot size).

|Optics for IN 5-L plus| | | |Optics for IN 5 plus and IN 5-H plus| |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| |Measuring Distance a [mm]|Spot Size M90 [mm]|Measuring Distance a [mm]|Spot Size M90 [mm]| |
| |100|1|100| |2|
| |200|17|200| |18|
| |300|33|300| |35|
| |200|7| |300|6|
| |300|3|300| |22|
| |500|15| |1000|45|
| |1000|45| |800|16|
| |400|11| |1500|36|
| |800|8| |2500|68|
| |1500|28| |Aperture D [mm]|15|
| |3000|71| | | |

The determination of the main spot size "M" in the main measuring distance "a" occurs at 90% measuring signal.

# INSTRUMENT SETTINGS

The most important parameters such as emissivity, exposure time, and analog output can be set directly in the instrument. After removing the cover on the back side of the pyrometer, the corresponding adjustments are available.

|Housing|Cover|
|---|---|
|Emissivity ε|Exposure Time t90|
|Analog output 0 or 4 ... 20 mA|Online / Offline|
|Electrical Connection|Adjustments|

The instruments can alternatively be switched in online mode to enable the communication via serial interface and software InfraWin (in scope of delivery) on a PC. This allows additional setting options as well as the graphical temperature display combined with subsequent analysis of the measurement values.

# INFRAWIN 5 OVERVIEW

InfraWin is easy-to-use measurement and evaluation software for remote configuration of stationary, digital Impac brand pyrometers.

This software allows the user to remotely adjust and control settings for one or two pyrometers from a single computer. InfraWin also allows the user to simultaneously monitor and control temperatures.

- Display temperature data as color bars and online graphics
- Capture downstream evaluations as tables, graphics or text files
- Calculate the spot size for different measuring distances
- Features UPP standard (Universal Pyrometer Protocol)

# Pyrometer Settings

An Impac digital pyrometer connected to a PC will be automatically detected by the software. All available parameters are adjustable, including emissivity, response time, maximum value storage, output signal and sub range.

Further special functions are adjustable, for example controllers or TV parameters on instruments available with these functions. Changes are transmitted directly to the pyrometer.

# Measurement with Color Bar

In this window a temperature value for the upper or lower limit can be adjusted numerically or with the mouse. The acquired minimum and maximum value is indicated as well as the inner temperature of the pyrometer. The emissivity is changeable during the measurement at any time.

# Infrared Calculator

After input of the aperture and the focused spot size per datasheet, the calculation of spot sizes at non-focused distances is possible.

Measurement with Internal Temperature of radiation temperature and internal instrument temperature. Parameters can be changed during the measurement.

I/O Module allows users to trigger measurement externally and gives a potential free output contact.
