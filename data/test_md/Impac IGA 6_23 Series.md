# IMPAC IGA 6/23 ADVANCED

# OVERVIEW

The fast response time of only 0.5 ms facilitates the measurement of fast and dynamic processes or short temperature peaks.

The integrated 4 digit LED display indicates the current measuring temperature or the currently set measuring distance. For a precise alignment of the pyrometers to the measuring object, the instruments are optionally equipped with a laser targeting light or a view finder. The pyrometers can be connected to a PC through an RS485 to USB connection, enabling the user to make parameter adjustments using the InfraWinsoftware. The software can be used for temperature indication, data logging, and further analyzing of complete temperature processes.

# IMPAC IGA 6/23 ADVANCED

# INFRAWIN 5 OVERVIEW

InfraWin is easy-to-use measurement and evaluation software for remote configuration of stationary, digital Impac brand pyrometers.

This software allows the user to remotely adjust and control settings for one or two pyrometers from a single computer. InfraWin also allows the user to simultaneously monitor and control temperatures.

- Display temperature data as color bars and online graphics
- Capture downstream evaluations as tables, graphics, or text files
- Calculate the spot size for different measuring distances
- Features UPP standard (Universal Pyrometer Protocol)

# Pyrometer Settings

An Impac digital pyrometer connected to a PC will be automatically detected by the software. All available parameters are adjustable, including emissivity, response time, maximum value storage, output signal, and sub-range.

Further special functions are adjustable, for example, controllers or TV parameters on instruments available with these functions. Changes are transmitted directly to the pyrometer.

# Measurement with Color Bar

In this window, a temperature value for the upper or lower limit can be adjusted numerically or with the mouse. The acquired minimum and maximum value is indicated as well as the inner temperature of the pyrometer. The emissivity is changeable during the measurement at any time.

# Infrared Calculator

After input of the aperture and the focused spot size per datasheet, the calculation of spot sizes at non-focused distances is possible.

|O"C7|82.9PC|
|---|---|
|104.7*C|110.0PC|

I/O Module allows users to trigger measurement externally and gives a potential free output contact.
