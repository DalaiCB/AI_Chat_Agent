# ARTESYN AIF 300V Vin SERIES

Advanced Energy's Artesyn AIF 300V Vin series of high voltage DC-DC converters comprises six single output models offering voltages of 1.8 V, 3.3 V, 5.0 V, 12 V, 15 V or 24 V. Designed for use with power factor correction (PFC) modules, the converters accept a wide range input of 250 to 420 VDC. They have a 600 watt continuous power rating at baseplate temperatures from -20 to 100˚C and can start up from temperatures as low as -40˚C. The output voltage can be adjusted using an analog signal, external resistor or digital data – there is a built-in I2C interface. The output of the 1.8 V and 3.3 V converters can be adjusted from 50% to 110% of nominal, while the 5 V, 12 V, 15 V and 24 V converters can be adjusted from 80% to 120% of nominal. Overvoltage and overcurrent protection thresholds can also be set by analog or digital control.
