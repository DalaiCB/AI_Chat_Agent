# SEKIDENKO 4100T OPTICAL FIBER THERMOMETER

Delivering precision temperature measurement across multiple processes and substrates

Advanced Energy’s Sekidenko 4100T multi-channel optical fiber thermometer (OFT) follows the leading Sekidenko OR4000T series pyrometers. It provides superior performance in non-contact temperature measurement by precisely measuring lower signal levels and reading lower temperature targets where speed and accuracy are key process requirements. The Sekidenko 4100T provides multi-channel capability and supports fast read rates up to 1 kHz for the most demanding temperature measurements. The instrument is modular in design and is readily tailored to meet the unique requirements of each process application.

IMPROVE TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENT ACCURACY

Advanced Energy’s Sekidenko 4100T multi-channel optical fiber thermometers (OFTs) deliver accurate, non-contact temperature measurements in a compact, modular platform designed to meet each unique application’s requirements. AE’s OFTs are ideally suited to measure temperature in the most tightly controlled applications where uniform, repeatable temperatures are required to enable process success. The 4100T model is commonly used in RTP, laser annealing, HDPCVD, MOCVD, ALD, UV cure and solar cell manufacturing and packaging.

The 4100T is designed as a drop-in replacement for the OR4000T, utilizing the same enclosure but offering a new touch screen for easier on-site control. The 4100T features a new touch screen display for users to easily adjust settings without the need for a laptop.

ENHANCE REPEATABILITY AND MINIMIZE VARIATION

Traditional thermocouple or other contact sensor measurements are unsuitable for many applications where physical contact with the substrate will cause damage and inaccuracy due to heat transfer effects. The 4100T OFT measures direct target temperature in situ—without contacting the object to be measured. This minimally invasive measurement approach lends itself well to cleanroom environments, extreme high-temperature environments, and highly chemically reactive situations where sensor-process interactions are unwanted. This leads to improved accuracy and repeatability in temperature readings.

Each OFT system consists of an instrument, an optical sensor, and optical fiber cables. The sensor gathers emitted near-infrared (NIR) light from the target, typically a substrate. A fiber optic cable then transmits the NIR light from the sensor to the instrument, where the collected light intensity is converted to a temperature reading. The use of a fiber optic cable allows for remote positioning of the instrument in a controlled environment away from the process environment. This places sensitive electronics well outside of the influence of electromagnetic radiation, rapidly changing ambient temperatures, and frees up precious space in the process environment. Each sensor is custom-designed to meet the functional and mechanical requirements of the unique, individual application. The results: reliable measurements, higher repeatability, and increased yield.
