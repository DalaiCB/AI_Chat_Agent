MIKRON M345X SERIES (X4, X6, X8, AND X12) Large area blackbody source for low temperatures cooled and heated by precision thermoelectric modules.

Designed to satisfy the exacting parameters of infrared focal plane array detectors, thermal imaging and forward looking infrared (FLIR) systems testing in static and moving scene applications, the Mikron® M345X series blackbody calibration sources combine fast slew rates, high emissivity, and unchallenged stability and uniformity. The M345X series blackbody sources are cooled and heated by precision thermoelectric modules (Peltier method) and are available in absolute or differential configurations. The two piece system is comprised of a bench mount controller and a separate emitter source enclosure.

# MIKRON M345X SERIES

# OVERVIEW

As part of an extensive range of general purpose and primary standards for testing and calibrating a wide variety of IR devices, the M345X series embodies the accumulated expertise of specialization in this discipline. The sources are available in emitter sizes ranging from 4"x4" (101 x 101 mm) up to 12" x 12" (305 x 305 mm) and in standard temperature range of 0.00 to 170°C (32 to 338°F) or 0.00°C to 150°C (32 to 302°F) for M345X12.

Blackbody calibration sources are infrared radiators used for calibrating and verifying the output signals of infrared thermometers (pyrometers), thermal imaging systems, heat flux measurement systems, or spectrographic analysis systems. Advanced Energy supplies a unique selection of very precise calibration sources that are traceable to national standards. Quotations for custom designs and variations are available upon request.

Mikron calibration sources have long been the gold standard to calibrate the instruments that keep your operations up and running. These blackbodies are superior because of the emissivity values, homogeneous emission areas, and a wide range of different sized apertures to adapt to the desired target area. In addition, fast heat-up times and high temperature stability are guaranteed. The quality of our calibration sources is guaranteed by tests, burn-in times, and radiometric calibrations. On most models, a certificate is provided to document the traceability to the international temperature scale ITS90 and NIST.

Ambient temperature must be ≤ 20°C to be able to reach 0°C emitter radiance temperature. When operating at ambient temperature of 20°C and need to make the setpoint 0°C, the setpoint must be “walked” down to 0°C.

1. Set the set point to 10°C and wait 2 minutes after it is somewhat stable.
2. Lower the set point to 5°C, 3°C, 2°C, 1°C, and then 0°C with about a 2 to 4 minute wait between set points. This permits the heat sink to remain cool.

“D” indicates ‘Differential model’ that has an RTD input for measuring a front plate aperture temperature (both supplied by customer).
