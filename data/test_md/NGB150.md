Note - EMI filtering is provided to meet the EMC requirements above. Unless otherwise stated, all tests are done at full load and 115 and 230Vac input. If any test would be marginal at other conditions, testing may be done at other stated conditions. All tests are to be performed in accordance with the stated standard. Acceptance is based on the supply continuing to function properly. Under some conditions, the outputs may pass through some level of signal. According to the standards, performance criteria are defined as following: A – Normal performance during and after the test B – Temporary degradation, self-recoverable C – Temporary degradation, operator intervention required to recover the operation D – Permanent damage
