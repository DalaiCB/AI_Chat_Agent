Notes:

1. Other output voltages available, consult factory.

2. Ripple & noise are measured at 20 MHz of bandwidth by using a 12" twisted pair-wire terminated with a 0.1 uF & 47 uF parallel capacitor.

3. Tolerance: includes setup time tolerance, line regulation and load regulation.

4. All specifications are typical at 230 VAC, full load, at 25°C ambient unless noted.
