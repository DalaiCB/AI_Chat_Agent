Paralleling Xsolo Products

Parallel Connection

To achieve increased currents Xsolo products can be paralleled. To connect in parallel the outputs must be trimmed to within 5 mV of each other and then the current share header J20 must be added to each Xsolo product.

Recommended Jumper for J20: HARWIN M7567-05

(Jumper Socket, Black, 2.54 mm, 2-way)
