# ARTESYN SIL15E SERIES Non-Isolated DC-DC Converters

Advanced Energy's Artesyn SIL15E series of non-isolated DC-DC converters comprises four SIL15E_05V models and a single SIL15_12V model. The SIL15E_12V converter accepts a 10 to 14 Vdc input and provides an output that can be adjusted over the range 0.8 to 3.63 Vdc. It can deliver up to 15 amps output current. Depending on the particular model, SIL15E series converters offer output power ratings of up to 54.4 watts and conversions efficiencies as high as 94%. Standard features include remote On/Off, remote sense, and comprehensive protection against short-circuit and overtemperature conditions. Packaged as through-hole vertical mount modules with a single-in-line footprint of just 0.3 x 2 inches (7.8 x 50.8 mm), SIL15E series converters have an installed height of 0.5 inch (12.7 mm).

# SIL15E_12 SERIES

OUTPUT VOLTAGE ADJUSTMENT

The ultra-wide output voltage trim range offers major advantages to users who select the SIL15E-12W3V3. It is no longer necessary to purchase a variety of modules in order to cover different output voltages. The output voltage can be trimmed in a range of 0.8 Vdc to 3.63 Vdc. When the SIL15E-12W3V3 converter leaves the factory the output has been adjusted to the default voltage of 0.8 V.

Notes:

1. The SIL15E features an ‘Positive Logic’ Remote ON/OFF operation. If not using the Remote ON/OFF pin, leave the pin open (the converter will be on). The Remote ON/OFF pin is referenced to ground. The following conditions apply for the SIL15E:
|Configuration|Converter Operation|
|---|---|
|Remote pin open circuit|Unit is ON|
|Remote pin pulled low [Von/off <0.8V]|Unit is OFF|
|Remote pin pulled high [Von/off >1.6 V]|Unit is ON|

An ‘Negative Logic’ Remote ON/OFF version is also possible with this converter. To order please place the suffix ‘R’ towards the end of the model number, e.g. SIL15E-12W3V3-VRJ.
2. Full derating curves available in both the Longform Datasheet and Application Note.
3. NOTICE: Some models do not support all options. Please contact your local Artesyn representative or use the on-line model number search tool at http://www.artesyn.com to find a suitable alternative.
