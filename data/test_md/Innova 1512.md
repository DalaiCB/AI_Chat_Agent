# INNOVA 1512

OVERVIEW

Gas selectivity for the Innova 1512 monitor is achieved through the use of optical filters. By installing up to five filters, the 1512 can measure the concentration of up to five component gases and water vapor in any air sample. The detection limit is gas-dependent, but is typically in the ppb region. In addition, the 1512 has a built-in pump system that allows samples to be drawn from up to 50 meters away.

Accuracy of these measurements is ensured by the 1512’s ability to compensate for temperature and pressure fluctuations, water vapor interference, and interference from other gases known to be present. Reliability is ensured by a series of self tests performed by the monitor. The self tests check software, data integrity, and the 1512’s components to ensure that they function properly. If a fault is found, it is reported in the measurement results, so that the integrity of the results can be ensured. This measurement system requires no consumables and very little regular maintenance. For most applications, recalibration is only necessary one to two times a year.

The monitoring system is easily operated through either the front panel, with its push-buttons and display providing short explanatory texts, or through the PC software. Both methods allow the user to configure the monitor, start a measurement sequence, and view the resulting concentration values of specific gases.

The monitor is equipped with standard interfaces: USB, Ethernet, and RS232. These enable the monitor to be integrated into automated process systems.

# MEASURING DETAILS

Selectivity
The gas selectivity of the 1512 is determined by the optical filters installed in its filter wheel. Because water is nearly always present in ambient air and absorbs infrared light at most wavelengths, it contributes to the total acoustic signal in the analysis cell. Therefore, the monitor is permanently fitted with a special filter that measures water vapor and enables the 1512 to compensate for water vapor interference. By selecting different filters, this technique can also be used to cross-compensate for known interferent gases.

Calibration
After the relevant optical filters are installed, the monitor must be calibrated. This is achieved through easy-to-use menu driven instructions. Thanks to its high stability, calibration of the 1512 is seldom necessary more than once a year. Calibration is performed using either the Calibration Software BZ7002 or directly from the 1512 front panel.

Operation
The 1512 monitoring system is easy to operate using either the application software LumaSoft Gas 7820 or 7880 or by using the front panel push-keys (which can be locked and accessed at three levels using passwords). The monitor can be operated as both an online and offline instrument (i.e. standalone operation). Using these user-interfaces with their logical division of information, everything that needs to be defined is achieved prior to starting the monitoring task.

Configuring the Monitor
The Set-up option enables all the parameters necessary to complete the monitoring task to be defined. This includes setting the Sample Integration Times (S.I.T.) option, which enables measurement results to be weighted - sensitivity against speed. When used as a system controller for multipoint monitoring, the same menu enables the setup of the Innova 1409’s multipoint sampling tasks.

Measurement Cycle
1. The pump draws air from the sampling point through the air filter to flush out the “old” air in the measurement system and replace it with a “new” air sample. The pressure sensor is used to check that the pump sequence is elapsed successfully and to measure the actual air pressure.
2. The “new” air sample is hermetically sealed In the analyses cell by closing the inlet and outlet valves.
3. Light from an infrared light source is reflected off a mirror, passed through a mechanical chopper, which pulsates it, and then through one of the optical filters in the filter wheel.
4. The gas being monitored selectively absorbs the light transmitted by the optical filter. Because the light is pulsating, the gas temperature increases and decreases, causing an equivalent increase and decrease in the pressure of the gas (an acoustic signal) in the closed cell.
5. Two microphones mounted in the cell wall measure this acoustic signal, which is directly proportional to the concentration of the monitored gas present in the cell.
6. The filter wheel turns so that light is transmitted through the next optical filter, and the new signal is measured. The number of times this step is repeated is dependent on the number of gases being measured.
7. The response time is approximately 13 seconds for one gas or water vapor, or approximately 26 seconds if five gases and water vapor are measured.

Alarms
Two alarm trigger levels, which provide high alarm limits for each measured gas, can be defined. These can also be linked to audible alarms using the relay outputs. In addition, the application software LumaSoft Gas 7820 or 7880 allows four alarm levels to be displayed.

Starting Measurements
Once the set-up parameters have been defined, measurements can be started immediately or later using a delayed start time. Once started, the monitoring task continues until it is stopped either manually or by using a defined stop time.

Maintenance
The only maintenance tasks necessary are calibration and replacement of the air filter. Both tasks are easily performed. The frequency for changing the air filter depends on the individual applications.

# MEASUREMENT DATA

Online Measurement Results

Using one or more of the monitor’s standard interfaces, measurement results are transferred directly to a PC. Here the results can be displayed on screen as real-time values in tables and graphs (see Fig. 1) or integrated into the process system.

Advanced Energy offers remote control capability through the user’s local area network using the LumaSoft Gas Single Point 7820 or Multi Point 7880 software. Online access to the measurement data is available via a built-in OPC server (alternatively via Microsoft Excel).

In the 7820/7880 software, the graphs can be configured to display only the desired gases, defined concentration ranges, and results from statistical analyses. Also, when using the 7880 software, all measurement data is stored in user-defined SQL Server 2014 database.

Optional Analog/Relay Interface Module UA1374

The functions of the 1512 can be expanded through the additional Analog/Relay Module UA1374. For each gas, barometric pressure, and chamber temperature, the following outputs are available:

|Accuracy|Zero Drift: ±0.25%|
|---|---|
|Voltage Output|±1.5% of full scale|
|Current Output|± 0.5% of full scale|
|Resolution|16 bit (0 to 20 mA and 0 to 10 V)|
|Measurement Range|Range and zero-point are scalable in the software. Maximum load resistance on current output is 800 Ω. Minimum load resistance for the voltage output is 1000 Ω.|

The analog outputs are galvanically isolated from the rest of the analyzer, but NOT from each other.

Offline Measurement Results

Gas measurement result data is displayed on the 1512’s screen (display memory) as soon as it is available, and is constantly updated. During a task, the 1512 performs running statistical analyses of the measured gas concentrations, calculating a variety of values for each monitored gas.

This data (in Display Memory) can be copied to the Background Memory, which is a non-volatile storage area. The internal memory stores the measurement readings on a gas per gas basis, but also across the sampling channels when applicable.

Data stored in Background Memory can be recalled to Display Memory. From this memory, data can be
