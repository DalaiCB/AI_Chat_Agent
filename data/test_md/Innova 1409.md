# INNOVA 1409

# OVERVIEW

The sampling system is configured from the system controller: either directly via the front panel interface of the gas monitor, or using one of the available software (BZ7007 or LumaSoft 7880). The 1409 communicates with the gas monitor over a USB interface. When using LumaSoft 7880 as a system controller, the computer is connected to the gas monitor via the RS232 serial, USB, or Ethernet interface.

The pneumatic system of the 1409 is shown below. The sampler system is constructed of AISI-316 stainless steel and PTFE (poly-tetrafluoroethylene) tubing to minimize adsorption of samples. The system has 6 to 24 inlet channels depending on the configuration. Each inlet channel has a tube mounting stub on the backplate of the 1409 to connect each channel to the respective sampling point. The 24 inlet channels converge into one; a three-way valve then directs the gas sample to the gas monitor for analysis, or through the external pump (optional) via the waste-air outlet on the 1409’s backplate.

The highly efficient 1409’s sampler system transports gas samples from the sampling point at approximately four meters per second. This speed depends on the type of pump, the diameter of the tubing, and the length of tubing attached to the 1409. An air filter is attached to the end of each sampling tube to keep the 1409 free of particles.

# MEASURING DETAILS

Control of the 1409

The 1409 is remotely controlled either by using the gas monitor as a system controller (the monitoring/sampling system then operates in standalone mode), or by LumaSoft 7880 Multipoint Software running on a computer connected to the gas monitor and communicating over the RS232, USB, or Ethernet interface. Commands and information requests are sent over the USB interface to the 1409 to control the sampler system and to read-out data.

System Use

The 1409 combined with a gas monitor offers wide-ranging monitoring capabilities. The 1409 makes it possible to perform multipoint monitoring tasks in a variety of situations and environments, without changing the system components. Air samples are drawn from up to 24 sampling points and delivered to the monitor. The monitor can then measure the concentrations of up to five gases, water vapor, and air pressure in each sample. With its design with a set of 3-way valves, the 1409 sampler can be equipped with an optional external pump: while the gas monitor analyzes the active channel, the system can already sample gas from the next channel in the sequence order.

Setting Up the Sampling Task

The selection of the active channels can be done either directly via the front panel interface of the gas monitor, or using one of the available software (7880 and BZ7007). The 7880 software enables to customize the sampling sequence across the active channels.

Standalone Multipoint Monitoring

Innova Photoacoustics Gas Monitors (1512, 1314i, 1412i, and 3434i) can be setup as a system controller. Their internal CPU is then synchronizing the sampling and gas measurement tasks; it stores the measurement readings in the internal memory on a gas per gas basis, and across the active sampling channels.

Online Multipoint Monitoring

The LumaSoft Gas Multipoint 7880 software offers full coordination and control of all the sampling and monitoring functions of the system. The software coordinates the functions of the instruments to form advancedenergy.com

# Reliability

Reliability is ensured by automatic self-tests of both hardware and software. The 1409’s operating status can be read-out at any time.

# Alarm Features

When operating in online multipoint monitoring with LumaSoft 7880, software alarms can be defined for each gas on each channel. In standalone operation with the 1314i Photoacoustic Monitor, alarm relays can be configured as an option, either for each gas on any channel or for selected channels on any gas.

# 1409 Configurations

1409-6: wip 6 channels
1409-12: wip 12 channels
1409-24: wip 24 channels

Rack Version

The 1409 can be delivered as a rack version by adding the flange panel for rack mount.
