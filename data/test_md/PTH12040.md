# ARTESYN PTH12040

PtH12040

12 Vin Single Output

Advanced Energy's Artesyn PTH12040 series non-isolated DC-DC converter complies with the Point-of-Load Alliance (POLA) standard. It offers some of the most advanced POL functions in the industry, including Auto-Track™ sequencing for controlled power-up/power-down of complex semiconductor devices such as DSPs, FPGAs and ASICs, and voltage margining. Standard features include pre-bias startup, programmable input undervoltage lockout, differential remote sense, remote On/Off and auto resetting short-circuit protection.

PTH12040 series converters have an input voltage range of 8 to 14Vdc and an output voltage that can be trimmed from 0.8 to 5.5 Vdc to meet a wide variety of semiconductor power needs.

Rated at 275 watts, the converters offer up to 93% efficiency and can deliver up to 50 amps. Available in through-hole horizontal mount and surface-mount versions, they have a small 1 x 2 inch (26.5 x 52 mm) footprint and an installed height of just 0.35 inch (9 mm).

# PTH12040

OUTPUT VOLTAGE ADJUSTMENT

The ultra-wide output voltage trim range offers major advantages to users who select the PTH12040W. It is no longer necessary to purchase a variety of modules in order to cover different output voltages. The output voltage can be trimmed in a range of 0.8 Vdc to 1.8 Vdc. When the PTH12040W converter leaves the factory the output has been adjusted to the default voltage of 0.8 V.

**Efficiency Table: PTH12040W (Io = 35 A)**
|Output Voltage|Efficiency|
|---|---|
|Vo = 5.0 V|96%|
|Vo = 3.3 V|95%|
|Vo = 2.5 V|93%|
|Vo = 2.0 V|92%|
|Vo = 1.8 V|91%|
|Vo = 1.5 V|90%|
|Vo = 1.2 V|88%|
|Vo = 1.0 V|86%|
|Vo = 0.8 V|82%|

Notes:

1. The set-point voltage tolerance is affected by the tolerance and stability of RSET. The stated limit is unconditionally met if RSET has a tolerance of 1% with 100 ppm/˚C or better temperature stability.
2. This control pin has an internal pull-up to 5 V nominal. If it is left open-circuit the module will operate when input power is applied. A small low leakage (&lt;100 nA) MOSFET is recommended for control. For further information, consult the related application note. For further information, consult Application Note 193.
3. A 1000 μF input capacitor is required for proper operation. The capacitor must be rated for a minimum of 300 mA rms of ripple current.
4. This is with a 1 A/μs loadstep, 50 to 100% Iomax, Io = 680 μF.
5. See Figures 1 and 2 for safe operating curves.
6. When the set-point voltage is adjusted higher than 3.6 V, a 10 V minimum input voltage is recommended.
7. A small low-leakage (&lt;100 nA) MOSFET is recommended to control this pin. The open circuit voltage is less than 1 Vdc.
8. These are the default voltages. They may be adjusted using the ‘UVLO Prog’ control input. Consult Application Note No. 193 for further information.
9. NOTICE: Some models do not support all options. Please contact your local Artesyn representative or use the on-line model number search tool at http://www.artesyn.com to find a suitable alternative.
