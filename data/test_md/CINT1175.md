# AC POWER FAIL/DC OK AND INHIBIT SIGNALS - J600

AC Power Fail / DC OKPower Fail / DC OK: During normal operation stays HIGH.Goes HIGH 100 to 500 ms after main output, HIGH: 4 V to 5.2 VGoes LOW with 5 ms warning before loss of output from AC failure, LOW: 0 to 0.8V

|Vc1|12v|
|---|---|
|10.0k|J600-Pin2|

Power supply

AC Power failure and DC OK signals use the same pin, so the signals can be used as follows:

- DC OK: Pin2 = HIGH & Pin1 = HIGH
- AC Power Fail: Pin2 = LOW & Pin1 = LOW

Inhibit

- Disable: Connect to output Common or pull down this pin below 10 V
- Enable: Floating or HIGH. HIGH: 10.5 V to 12.6 V
