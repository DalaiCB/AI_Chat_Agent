# TREK PD04002A

Versatile microprocessor-based charged plate monitor ideally suited to monitor the performance of air ionizers that are used in critical wide temperature operations.

The ultra-sensitive Trek® PD04002A makes it the ideal choice in air ionizer monitor applications where small area ion collecting sensors are used to meet the requirement for high accuracy ion balance measurement to levels of less than one volt. The voltage of the charged plate is initialized prior to discharge time testing. Balance tests, positive discharge tests, and negative discharge tests can be initialized from a remote location through digital command signals. The Trek PD04002A utilizes a new technique that requires less than 0.1 picoampere of ion field current to achieve full accuracy and stability. Other product designs require up to 2000 times more ion current to be drawn from the ion field to achieve stability.
