# OVERVIEW

Regulatory frames, like the European F-Gas Directive (EC 517/2014), are mandating the use of leak detection systems in the vast majority of high-voltage SF6-GIS installations in order to better mitigate the risk of SF6 emissions. Specifically, when the existing gas instrumentation is not accurate enough to provide early detection: pressure/density switches used for safety considerations (to prevent catastrophic failure) lack of sensitivity and manual leak checks only provide discrete check points. Instead, stationary leak detection systems enable a permanent monitoring and early warning in the case of a leakage event occurring.

The Innova 3731 system leverages more than 20 years of leadership on the ultra-sensitive photoacoustic sensing technique to provide a direct and integral leak detection solution capable of monitoring large switchgear rooms. The system verifies that the GIS

# MEASURING DETAILS

Operation
The Innova 3731 leak detection system operates in standalone mode using the gas monitor as the system controller. It self-synchronizes the monitoring and sampling tasks. The system follows a fixed sampling sequence, measuring the active sampling channels in their basic order. The user can define a fixed interval in between two sequences.

Setting Up the System
The monitor and sampler units are rack-mountable on a standard 19" chassis. The user decides where the measurement points should be located and connects the sampler unit to each location with tubing. A short tubing piece connects the sampler’s outlet to the monitor’s inlet. The units communicate via USB interface.

accessed at three levels using passwords). Using these user-interfaces with their logical division of information, everything that needs to be defined is achieved prior to starting the multipoint monitoring task.

Within the setup tree, the Sample Integration Time (S.I.T.) is set, enabling measurement results to be weighted—sensitivity versus speed.

Starting Measurements
Once the set-up parameters have been defined, measurements can be started immediately or later using a delayed start time. Once started, the monitoring task continues until it is stopped either manually or by using a defined stop time.

Setting up the tasks of the leak detection system is easy using either the remote/offline software (BZ7007) or the front panel push-keys (which can be locked and BZ7007 Software Switchgear Room Remote/Offline User Interface MCC or RTU RRAA INNOVA 3731 Leak Detection System Gas Sample
Figure 1: The Innova 3731 SF6 leak detection system features ultra-high sensitivity with state-of-the-art photoacoustic monitor. It draws air samples from up to 24 locations for maximum coverage of the GIS substation. Tubing lines can easily run into existing control cable trays, or trenches. Analog and alarm relay outputs can be connected to local RTU.

Offline Measurement Results (Standalone Operation)

LumaSoft 7870 can provide real-time graphical display Gas measurement result data is displayed on the monitor’s screen (Display Memory) as soon as it is available, and is constantly updated. The internal database structures the measurement readings on a gas per gas basis, and across the sampling channels. This data in Display Memory can be copied to the Background Memory, which is a non-volatile storage area. Data stored in Background Memory can also be recalled to Display Memory. From this memory, data can be exported via the Remote/Offline Software in either excel or text file format.

Analog and Alarm Relay Outputs

The 3731 system features an analog/relay module with analog output (0-10 V, or 4-20 mA) for detection trending and 12 configurable alarm relay outputs for more detailed reporting of alarm conditions. Furthermore, two outputs are also available for relaying warning/error flags and for system watchdog function.

In particular, the Channel Mode is useful for multi-zone monitoring applications with the need to alarm on a zone-by-zone basis. Alarm relays are attributed to one or multiple sampling channels (defining a specific zone) and will trigger upon detection of alarm concentration on any of the monitored gas (for that zone). The Remote/Offline BZ7007 software enables the setup of the alarm levels and of the relay module.

Remote Control Option

The 3731 system offers remote control capability through the user’s LAN, USB, or RS232 interfaces using the optional LumaSoft Gas Multi Point 7870 software. This option enables the online monitoring of the leak detection system. The user-friendly interface of the BZ7007 Remote and Offline software allows for the complete setup of the monitoring and sampling tasks to be performed by the standalone measurement system. It also reports the current status of the system to which it is connected, and enables the user to start/stop the measurement task.

Reliable by Design

The leak detector’s extended self-test routines maintain the reliability of the results, which are stored in the internal memory of the gas monitor and can be downloaded as required. Alarm relays are available to report any warning/error on the system to the end user.

Detection Trending and Automatic Alarms

Analog output is available for detection trending over time. Measurements are also stored in the internal memory and can be exported to a remote LAN computer via user-friendly software interface. Finally, configurable zone alarms can be relayed to a local RTU.

If the power supply fails, the 3731 system will automatically restart when power is restored. Measurement data stored in the monitor’s memory is not affected by power loss.

Low Maintenance

It is only recommended to calibrate the gas monitor only once per year. The calibration can be done without the requirement of an equipment outage. The only other maintenance task necessary is changing the air filter on each active sampling channel.

Selectivity and Accuracy

The monitor is permanently fitted with a special filter that measures water vapor and enables the monitor to compensate for water vapor interference. Additional auto-compensation for temperature and pressure fluctuations helps to achieve exceptional accuracy.

Calibration

Calibration is performed using either the Calibration Software BZ7002 or directly from the front panel using the easy-to-use menu-driven instructions.
