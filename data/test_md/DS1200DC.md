# ARTESYN DS1200DC 1200 Watt Distributed Power System

Advanced Energy's Artesyn DS1200DC series bulk front end power supplies is the DC-input version of its DS1200 AC-input counterpart. Mechanically identical to the AC-input version, this product allows system operation from a Telco style 48 VDC input. Rated at 1,200 watts, the power supply provides a main 12 V output and a 3.3 V or optional 5.5 V standby output. Active current sharing allows this power supply to be paralleled with the AC-input version, for use in battery back-up systems where both AC and DC input capabilities are required.

# LOGIC CONTROL

|PS_SEATED (A4)|TTL logic LOW if power supply is seated into system connector. This is a short pin. A logic HIGH if the PSU is removed.|
|---|---|
|PWR GOOD (C3)|Active TTL high when output is within regulation limits.|
|AC OK (B1)|A low logic level if the input voltage is within allowable limits. A TTL logic HIGH level, and a 5 mS early warning signal before 12.0 V DC output loss of regulation.|
|PS_INHIBIT/PS_KILL (B4)|When left open power supply operation will be inhibited. When the power supply is inserted into the system, this pin will be pull low by the system and turn the power supply on only after all other power supply pins have seated.|
|PS ON (A1)|The output will be enabled when this signal is pulled low, below 0.8 V outputs disabled when pin is driven high or left open.|
