TREK 875

Electrostatic voltage sensor designed for in-line monitoring of electrostatic charge build-up.

The Trek® 875 electrostatic voltage sensor is designed for in-line monitoring of electrostatic charge build-up, which if left unchecked, can disrupt manufacturing processes or cause product degradation and early life failure of semi-conductors and other charge-sensitive components. Excellent for monitoring static charge levels within manufacturing equipment such as conveyors, handlers, and other tools, the Trek 875 features an automatic calibration technique to maintain high accuracy and speed over wide variations of spacing between the non-contacting measurement probe and the surface under test.

|AT A GLANCE|
|---|
|Measurement Range|0 to ±500 V DC or peak AC|
|Measurement Accuracy|At the Voltage Monitor Output Better than ±0.5% of full scale|
| |At the Current Monitor Output Better than ±3% of full scale|
|Speed of Response|Less than 25 ms for a 0 to ±500 V step change|

Other features include a voltage measurement range of ±500 VDC or peak AC, accuracy of ±0.5%, speed of 25 ms, and low noise of 1% rms of full scale. Buffered output voltage and current monitors (4 to 20mA) are provided for remote monitoring and alarm purposes. The unit is powered by +24 VDC and is housed in a standard DIN package to enable standardized mounting.

# TECHNICAL DATA

|Performance Specifications|
|---|
|Measurement Range|0 to ±500 VDC or peak AC|
|Accuracy|At the Voltage Monitor Output: Better than ±0.5% of full scale At the Current Monitor Output: Better than ±3% of full scale|
|Speed of Response|Less than 25 ms for a 0 to ±500 V step change (10 to 90%)|
|Current Monitor (4 to 20 mA)|Linearly related to the measured input voltage. Scale Factor (+4 mA to +20 mA representing a -500 V to +500 V): -500 V = 4 mA 0 V = 12 mA +500 V = 20 mA|

|Probe Specifications|

# Features

- Voltage Monitor Output: A buffered low-voltage replica of the measured voltage.
Scale Factor: 1 V / 50 V.
Noise: Less than 1% rms of full scale.
- Digital Enable: An external control TTL signal. A TTL HIGH (or open) will disable all internal power supplies. A TTL LOW will provide normal ESVM operation.
- Fault Warning Output: A TTL output signal. A TTL HIGH indicates normal operation of the Trek 875. A TTL LOW indicates a fault condition such as: out of range operation (circuit is measuring a voltage greater than ±500 Volts), failure of the probe, or circuit malfunction.
