ARTESYN SIL/SMT40C2 SERIES C-Class Non-Isolated

Advanced Energy's Artesyn SIL40C2 and SMT40C2 series of 40 amp non-isolated DC-DC converters are designed for cost- and space-sensitive applications. Both converters accept a wide range 4.5 to 13.8 VDC input and provide an output that is adjustable from 0.6 to 5.0 VDC to accommodate a wide variety of silicon power needs. Rated at 200 watts, the converters are capable of delivering up to 40 amps and have a typical efficiency of 94%. Standard features include remote sense, remote On/Off and remote ‘power good’ indication. These converters also support current sharing – multiple modules can be connected in parallel.

# SIL/SMT40C2

OUTPUT VOLTAGE ADJUSTMENT

The ultra-wide output voltage trim range offers major advantages to users who select the SIL40C2 series. It is no longer necessary to purchase a variety of modules in order to cover different output voltages. The output voltage can be trimmed in a range of 0.6-5 V. When the SIL40C2 converter leaves the factory, the output has been adjusted to the default voltage of 0.6 V.

Notes:

1. Measured as per recommended system capacitance.
2. di/dt = 10 A/μs, Vin = Nom, Tc = 25 °C, load change = 0.75 Io to full Io and full Io to 0.75.
3. External input fusing is recommended.
4. Additional part numbers may be available with different output voltages.
5. Airflow dependent, 100 LFM minimum required.
6. No capacitors needed for ripple current stability.
7. No capacitors needed for stability.
8. NOTICE: Some models do not support all options. Please contact your local Artesyn Embedded Power representative or use the on-line model number search tool at http://www.artesyn.com to find a suitable alternative.
9. To order a Horizontal Mounting option with a pin length of 0.165”, please use model SIL40C2-00S-HP5.
