# OPTICS

Depending on the selected type, the pyrometers are equipped ex works with different optics which are focusing on different distances, i.e. in this distances they achieve the smallest spot size in relation to the measuring distance. At any other distances (shorter or longer) the spot size will decrease or increase. Please note that the measuring object must be at least as big as the spot size.

# SETTINGS AND OPERATION VIA THE RS485 INTERFACE

With connection to the power supply the instruments are ready for use immediately. Following the signal processing either can be done via the analog ouput (e.g. for connection of a digital display) or via the digital RS485 interface (for connection of a PC or to a PLC). The included InfraWin software enables easy instrument settings and multiple graphical temperature illustration views.

With RS485, long transmission distances can be realized and several pyrometers can be connected in a bus system.

InfraWin software enables easy instrument settings, display of temperature curves, graphic, or tabular analysis, e.g. for printing out or exporting, and quick spot size calculation.

# INFRAWIN 5 OVERVIEW

InfraWin is easy-to-use measurement and evaluation software for remote configuration of stationary, digital Impac brand pyrometers.

This software allows the user to remotely adjust and control settings for one or two pyrometers from a single computer. InfraWin also allows the user to simultaneously monitor and control temperatures.

- Display temperature data as color bars and online graphics
- Capture downstream evaluations as tables, graphics or text files
- Calculate the spot size for different measuring distances
- Features UPP standard (Universal Pyrometer Protocol)

# Pyrometer Settings

An Impac digital pyrometer connected to a PC will be automatically detected by the software. All available parameters are adjustable, including emissivity, response time, maximum value storage, output signal and sub range.

Further special functions are adjustable for example controllers or TV parameters on instruments available with these functions. Changes are transmitted directly to the pyrometer.

# Measurement with Color Bar

In this window a temperature value for the upper or lower limit can be adjusted numerically or with the mouse. The acquired minimum and maximum value is indicated as well as the inner temperature of the pyrometer. The emissivity is changeable during the measurement at any time.

# Infrared Calculator

After input of the aperture and the focused spot size per datasheet, the calculation of spot sizes at non-focused distances is possible.

Measurement with Internal Temperature of radiation temperature and internal instrument temperature. Parameters can be changed during the measurement.

I/O Module allows users to trigger measurement externally and gives a potential free output contact.
