TREK PZD2000A

Wide bandwidth, high voltage power amplifier for precision high power applications featuring an all-solid-state design for high reliability and low-noise operation.

The Trek® PZD2000A is a wide bandwidth, high voltage power amplifier used for precision high power applications. The amplifier incorporates an all-solid-state design for high reliability and low-noise operation. Its four quadrant output stage sinks as well as sources load current throughout the output voltage range, thus achieving accurate output response and high slew rates, even into highly capacitive loads.

PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS

- DC accuracy is better than 0.1% of full scale
- Precision voltage and current monitors provide buffered low-voltage representations of the high-voltage output and load current for monitoring purposes, or for use as feedback signals in closed-loop systems
- Remote high-voltage ON-OFF suitable for use with automated or computer controlled systems
- Output stage fully protected against over voltage and over current conditions that may be generated by active loads, overloads or arcing to ground
- Adjustable current limit or current trip level
- NIST-traceable Certificate of Certification provided with each unit shipped
