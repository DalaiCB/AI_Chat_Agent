|Test Probes/Accessories|
|---|
|Trek 152BP-5P Test Probes|Set of 2 (2.27 kg / 5 lb). Available for performing resistance measurements including ANSI/ESD STM 4.1 standards (point-to-point or resistance to ground measurement)|
|Trek 152P-2P Two-Point Resistance Probe|Performs measurements on surface areas too small to be measured with conventional probes|
|Trek 152P-CR-1 Surface/Volume Concentric Ring Probe|Measures surface and volume resistance of materials as per IEC or ESDA standards. A three (3) position switch on the probe selects either SURFACE distance or VOLUME resistance measurements with either a GUARDED or UNGUARDED outer electrode. Uses an exclusive built-in pre-amplifier design.|
|Test Plate Set (consists of two separate plates)|Conductive Plate 127 x 127 mm (5 x 5 in) A stainless steel conductive plate with a mini banana plug|
| |Insulative Plate 137 x 137 mm (5.4 x 5.4 in) Acts as an insulative surface|
|Walking Test Adapter Kit|The Walking Test Adapter allows the analysis of resistance levels on the human body (STM 97.1)|

1 The Trek 152-CR-1 will operate with the previous Trek 152 resistivity meter in “surface” mode, just as the Trek152-CR probe did. The 152-CR will operate with the Trek152-1 Resistance Meter with the measurement being in “ohms,” not “ohms/sq.”
