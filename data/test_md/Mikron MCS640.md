# MIKRON MCS640 AND MCS640-HD

Compact, short wavelength thermal imaging process cameras for non-contact temperature measurement of metallic, graphite, or ceramics.

The Mikron® MCS640 and MCS640-HD are short wavelength infrared (SWIR) thermal imagers with internal digital signal processing. These imagers are designed to accurately measure temperatures between 600 and 3000°C (1112 to 5432°F), with minimal interference from temperature reflections on the object. This makes it suitable for applications such as measurements on metallic surfaces, graphite, and ceramics, etc.

# MIKRON MCS640 • MCS640-HD

# OVERVIEW

The compact design of the Mikron MCS640 enables the integration of the camera into compact production machines, while the solid and robust housing guarantees reliability even in harshest industrial environments. The Mikron MCS640-HD can be paired with an optional water-cooled enclosure for additional protection in harsh industrial environments where ambient temperatures exceed 50°C.

Advanced Energy offers a wide variety of compatible optics for the MCS640 and MCS640-HD, allowing each instrument to be configured exactly to the measurement needs of the desired scene. Microscopic lenses are also available, allowing accurate measurement of small objects, such as filament temperatures.

The 640 x 460 resolution pixel detector is designed to allow precise targeting of small objects in a wider field of view. The built-in Gigabit Ethernet interface (GigE) allows the camera to be connected to the network for long data transmission or to Advanced Energy’s application software for further analysis.
