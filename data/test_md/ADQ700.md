# ARTESYN ADQ700 SERIES

700 Watt Quarter Brick DC-DC Converter

ADQ700 series quarter-brick isolated DC-DC converters produce a single fully regulated 12 V output. Rated at 700 watts, these converters can deliver up to 58 amps output current and have no minimum load requirement. They have an input voltage range of 40 to 60 V and are primarily designed for use with standard 48 V supplies in computing and server applications, as well as regulated 48V supplies in communications equipment.
