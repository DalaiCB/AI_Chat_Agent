Arc Management System Technology

AE’s proprietary AMS (Arc Management System) technology preserves film quality and repeatability, even under extreme arcing conditions. These enhanced arc handling capabilities enable success with newer materials, such as AZO and IGZO.

Automatic arc handling eliminates need to adjust arc management parameters.

Primary arc response quickly removes power from arcs.

Secondary arc response cools surface and quenches secondary arcs.

Controlled power recovery minimizes over-shoot and secondary arcs.

Low stored energy — less than 0.4 mJ per kW — reduces arc impact on the process.
