-20°C to +70°C

Humidity

80% maximum relative humidity up to 31°C, reducing linearly to 50% at 40°C. Non-condensing (ref BS EN61010-1)

Altitude

Sea level up to 2000 metres (6500 feet)

Installation Category

II (BS EN61010-1)

Pollution Degree

2 (BS EN61010-1)

Usage

Indoor use only

Protection

The units are fully protected against over-temperature and overcurrent, peak arc current is resistively limited.

Arc Count and Extinguish

Each time the ACE system detects an arc it blanks the supply off for a brief period to extinguish the arc. The unit is then allowed to recover. If more arcs occur they are counted to determine the arc rate; if this exceeds a safe level the power supply is shut down. The parameters are factory set to 25 arcs in any 5 second period.

Cooling

Fan assisted, air is drawn in via side panel vents and exits at the rear of the unit. Minimum airflow required is 3m/s. Ambient air around the unit must not exceed 40°C.

Safety

The Series OL1K meets the requirements of the Low Voltage Directive, 2006/95/EC, by complying with BS EN61010-1:2001 when installed as a component part of compliant equipment. It is CE marked accordingly.

Safety Class

Equipment Class 1

EMC1

EN55022 Class B for conducted and radiated emissions

EN61000-4-2 ESD - levels ±4 kV contact, ±8 kV air discharge

EN61000-4-4 Fast transients on mains input - levels ±2 kV

EN61000-4-5 surges - levels ±2 kV line to earth, ±1 kV line to line

EN61000-4-8 magnetic fields - levels 30 A/m at 50/60 Hz

EN61000-4-11 voltage dips, interruptions

RoHS

The OL1K is currently built to non-RoHS standard. This unit can, however, be configured to meet the requirements of RoHS where significant customer demand requires it, although please note that this will have an impact on delivery timescales.

1 The Series OL1K is intended for installation as a component of a system and is designed to meet these requirements. The unit will not trip and recovers to normal operation after a disturbance as defined in SEMI F47-0706. The EMC performance of the power supply can only be fully assessed when installed within, and as a part of, the final system.

# Series OL1K

HIGH VOLTAGE POWER SUPPLYHITEK POWER OL1K SERIES INTERFACE

Remote Control Interface Connections:

The OL1K series is fitted with an analogue remote control interface, controlled via a 25-way female D-type connector:

|V STATUS INDICATOR|I STATUS INDICATOR|HV OUTPUT VOLTAGE MONITOR|TRIP INDICATOR|LOCAL INDICATOR|HV ON INDICATION|PROGRAM VOLTAGE MONITOR|HV ON Lo|HV ON Hi|PROGRAM VOLTAGE Hi|PROGRAM VOLTAGE Lo|0V|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|10|11|12|
|14|15|16|17|18|19|20|21|22|23|24|25|

All logical indicators are open collector outputs rated at 16V (max) in the off state. An internal 100Ω resistor is connected in series with the open collector transistor. The pull-down voltage is 0.9V plus the internal resistor drop.

All analog Voltage and Current Monitors are 0 to +10V ±0.5% ±20mV, with respect to pin 13, representing 0 to rated output. Signal impedance is less than 100Ω and minimum external load resistance is 2kΩ.

For ordering information and to find a solution for your exact requirements, please contact your local Advanced Energy sales representative.

All analogue Voltage and Current Inputs are 0V to +10V on the Hi input with respect to the Lo input, representing 0V to rated output ±0.2% of setting ±0.1% of rating. Input impedance is greater than 50kΩ.

These component power supplies meet the requirements of EC Directive 73/23/EEC (LVD). advancedenergy.com
