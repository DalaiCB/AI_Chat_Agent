# ULTRAVOLT M SERIES

The miniature, micro-sized M series is the ideal solution for applications requiring biasing voltage ranging from 0 to 3000 V and very small current—only 16.4 cc (1.00 in3). Less than 12.7 mm (0.5") high, these modules are ideal for low-profile applications.

# PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS

- Seven models from 0 to 600, 1000, 1250, 1500, 2000, 2500, or 3000 V
- Output power: 0.5, 0.8, or 1 W
- Tight line/load regulation
- Arc and continuous short circuit protection
- Self-restoring output voltage
- Low cost
- Miniature and lightweight
- Voltage monitoring
- Low ripple (0.01% peak to peak)
- Optional flying lead
- UL/cUL recognized, IEC-60950-1, CE Mark (LVD and RoHS)

# TYPICAL APPLICATIONS

- Bias supplies
- Electrostatic chucks
- Hand held x-ray florescence (XRF)
- Avalanche photo diodes (APD)
- Photomultiplier tubes (PMT)
