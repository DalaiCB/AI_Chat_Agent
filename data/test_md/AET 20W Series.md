# ARTESYN AET SERIES 20 Watts

Advanced Energy's Artesyn AET series of 20 watt isolated DC-DC converters is available with an ultra wide 9–36 Vdc or 18–75 Vdc input. Each of these versions offers a choice of five single output models, with voltages of 2.5 V, 3.3 V, 5 V, 12 V or 15 V, and three dual output models offering +5/-5 V, +12/-12 V or +15/-15 V. The converters are encapsulated in a 2 x 1.6 inch (50.8 x 40.6 mm) metal case and have a height of just 0.48 inch (12.2 mm). They are ideal for ruggedized applications involving harsh environments. Standard features include 1,500 Vdc input/output isolation, overvoltage protection and short-circuit protection with auto-restart.
