# IMPAC IS 12-TSP AND IGA 12-TSP

Fully digital, extremely precise transfer standard pyrometer (TSP) for accuracy inspection of calibration sources.

The Impac® IS 12-TSP and IGA 12-TSP are extremely precise and long-term stable transfer standard pyrometers which are specifically designed for checking calibration sources. The pyrometers are available in several temperature ranges between 200 and 3000°C (392 and 5432°F), as well as in various spectral ranges. This means they can be used with calibration sources with which pyrometers with Silicon or Indium Gallium Arsenide detectors can be checked. The detectors in the transfer standard pyrometer are thermostatically controlled to achieve this high precision. This means that the measurement is, to a large extent, independent of surrounding temperature variations and allows a resolution of 0.01°C to be achieved.

# IMPAC IS 12-TSP • IGA 12-TSP

# OVERVIEW

Calibration sources are subject to heavy wear due to the extremely high temperatures which they have to produce. This can lead to the fact that, over time, the temperature display at the controller no longer corresponds to the radiation temperature in the spectral range being investigated. If high precision measurements are required on the calibration source over long periods of time, we recommend that regular checks are carried out. Use of a transfer standard pyrometer ensures that temperature values as stipulated by national institutes can be transferred to your own calibration sources to guarantee traceability to the ITS90 international temperature scale. In order to guarantee an adherence to high technical specifications, the transfer standard pyrometer should be checked regularly by Advanced Energy. This is, however, only necessary every two years thanks to the pyrometer’s solid construction.

# INFRAWIN 5 OVERVIEW

InfraWin is easy-to-use measurement and evaluation software for remote configuration of stationary, digital Impac brand pyrometers.

This software allows the user to remotely adjust and control settings for one or two pyrometers from a single computer. InfraWin also allows the user to simultaneously monitor and control temperatures.

- Display temperature data as color bars and online graphics
- Capture downstream evaluations as tables, graphics, or text files
- Calculate the spot size for different measuring distances
- Features UPP standard (Universal Pyrometer Protocol)

# Pyrometer Settings

An Impac digital pyrometer connected to a PC will be automatically detected by the software. All available parameters are adjustable, including emissivity, response time, maximum value storage, output signal, and sub-range.

Further special functions are adjustable, for example, controllers or TV parameters on instruments available with these functions. Changes are transmitted directly to the pyrometer.

# Measurement with Color Bar

In this window, a temperature value for the upper or lower limit can be adjusted numerically or with the mouse. The acquired minimum and maximum value is indicated as well as the inner temperature of the pyrometer. The emissivity is changeable during the measurement at any time.

# Infrared Calculator

After input of the aperture and the focused spot size per datasheet, the calculation of spot sizes at non-focused distances is possible.

82.9°C104.7°C110.0°C

Measurement with Internal Temperature of radiation temperature and internal instrument temperature. Parameters can be changed during the measurement.

I/O Module allows users to trigger measurement externally and gives a potential free output contact.
