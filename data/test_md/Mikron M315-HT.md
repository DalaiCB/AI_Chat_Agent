# MIKRON M315-HT

Portable, two-piece low temperature blackbody calibration source with a large surface area. Ambient +5 to 450°C (+9 to 842°F).

The Mikron® M315-HT is a two-piece portable blackbody calibration source with a digital indicating temperature controller that can be set at any temperature between ambient 5 to 450°C (9 to 842°F). Once set, the source temperature is controlled to within ±0.3°C by an internal RTD sensor. The unit has an emissivity of 1.00 @ 8 to 14 μm. The M315-HT calibration source and the digital indicating temperature controller are contained in separate housings to allow greater flexibility in positioning the instrument within an installation, e.g. long path calibration.

# OVERVIEW

Blackbody calibration sources are infrared radiators used for calibrating and verifying the output signals of infrared thermometers (pyrometers), thermal imaging systems, heat flux measurement systems, or spectrographic analysis systems. Advanced Energy supplies a unique selection of very precise calibration sources that are traceable to national standards. Quotations for custom designs and variations are available upon request.

Mikron calibration sources have long been the gold standard to calibrate the instruments that keep your operations up and running. These blackbodies are superior because of the emissivity values, homogeneous emission areas, and a wide range of different sized apertures to adapt to the desired target area. In addition, fast heat-up times and high temperature stability are guaranteed. The quality of our calibration sources is guaranteed by tests, burn-in times, and radiometric calibrations. On most models, a certificate is provided to document the traceability to the international temperature scale ITS90 and NIST.
