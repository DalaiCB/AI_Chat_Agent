MIKRON M315X (X4, X6)

Two-piece medium temperature blackbody calibration source wip a large surface area.
Ambient +5 to 400°C (+9 to 752°F).

The Mikron® M315X series blackbody calibration sources are resistively heated by precision heating elements to provide uniform temperature distributions. The two-piece system is comprised of controller module and a separate enclosure for the emitter source. Emitter source temperature control is carried out by a precision digital PID controller. Designed to satisfy the exacting parameters of infrared focal plane array detectors, thermal imaging, and FLIR systems testing in projection scene and field application, the M315X series blackbody calibration sources combine high emissivity and unchallenged stability and uniformity.

# MIKRON M315X

# OVERVIEW

Blackbody calibration sources are infrared radiators used for calibrating and verifying the output signals of infrared thermometers (pyrometers), thermal imaging systems, heat flux measurement systems, or spectrographic analysis systems. Advanced Energy supplies a unique selection of very precise calibration sources that are traceable to national standards. Quotations for custom designs and variations are available upon request.

Mikron calibration sources have long been the gold standard to calibrate the instruments that keep your operations up and running. These blackbodies are superior because of the emissivity values, homogeneous emission areas, and a wide range of different sized apertures to adapt to the desired target area. In addition, fast heat-up times and high temperature stability are guaranteed. The quality of our calibration sources is guaranteed by tests, burn-in times, and radiometric calibrations. On most models, a certificate is provided to document the traceability to the international temperature scale ITS90 and NIST.
