# ARTESYN DC Input DS450DC-3/DS550DC-3 Distributed Power Bulk Front-End

Advanced Energy's Artesyn DS450DC and DS550DC series bulk front end power supplies are the DC-input versions of their DS450 and DS550 AC-input counterparts. Mechanically identical to the AC versions, these products allow system operation from a Telco style 48 VDC input. Rated at 450 and 550 watts, the DS450/550 power supplies generate a main DC output of 12 VDC and a 3.3 VDC for powering standby circuitry. Standard features include active current sharing, internal ORing FETs and an EEPROM for storing service data to facilitate efficient field replacement. An I2C communication interface is provided for the FRU EEPROM data.

The power supply output will be enabled when this signal is pulled low (&lt; 0.8 V).

HIGH = Output V1 OFF

LOW = Output V1 ON

Active High signal asserted when the input voltage rises above the min input voltage specified.

This signal is internally pulled up through 4.7 Kohms to the 3.3 V housekeeping voltage.

Active High signal asserted when the output is within regulation. This signal is internally pulled up through 1.0 Kohms to the 3.3 V housekeeping voltage.

This open collector signal generates two pulses per each fan revolution. This signal is eternally pulled up to the housekeeping voltage.

This signal will cause the output to shut down when drive high (&gt; 24 V) or left floating. The PS_KILL will cause the output to latch off and requires recycle of PS_ON or DC input to reset.
