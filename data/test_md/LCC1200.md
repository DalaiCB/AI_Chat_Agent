|Total Power|1200 W|
|# of Outputs|Single|
|Outputs|24, 28, 48 VDC|

Advanced Energy's Artesyn LCC1200 series of fully enclosed conduction cooled AC-DC power supplies comprises four models, offering main output voltages of 24 V, 28 V or 48 V. Each model also provides a 5 VDC standby output that can supply up to 1.5 A. Rated at 1200 W, these power supplies incorporate a thermal baseplate and are capable of delivering full output power over a wide operating baseplate temperature range of -40 to 85°C. For maximum applications flexibility, the main output is adjustable. The 28 V model, for example, can be adjusted from 24 to 30 V and has a maximum current rating of 42.9 A.
