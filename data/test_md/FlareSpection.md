# FLARESPECTIONTM

Infrared camera system for continuous pilot flame and flare stack monitoring in hazardous areas.

Advanced Energy's FlareSpectionTM system is a complete flare monitoring solution. This thermal imaging system can monitor both the flare and the pilot light continuously, through adverse weather and environmental conditions, around the clock. Our unique optics, enclosures, and calibrations focus on critical combustion regions—even through moisture, heavy rain, fog, dust, or smoke. Our best-in-class optics offer higher resolution at longer distances, allowing for camera mounting in convenient locations and enabling installation and maintenance while the flare is still in service.

# PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS

- Superior image quality using a telephoto (200 mm) lens, enabling detailed view of flares from distances up to 300 m
- High resolution 640 x 480 pixel thermal imager provides unmatched spatial resolution
- Individual pilot monitoring, even in the presence of a main flame
- Detects a wide range of flame types, including hydrogen flames
- Stainless steel enclosure designed for hazardous area
- Industry’s most advanced software enabling automated and seamless integration with plant DCS
- Easy installation and maintenance from remote mounted location

The camera system is ATEX certified for use in the harshest locations and easily integrates into your existing DCS and/or re-ignition system.

# FLARESPECTION

OVERVIEW

With an adjustable mount and base, the powerful lens and high resolution camera offer a clear view of flare details from a convenient ground mounting location. The camera is protected in a stainless steel enclosure with an integrated site tube to prevent dust and dirt on the window, allowing for uninterrupted use with minimal maintenance. The software includes the capability to log performance for audits, record video for reviewing of historical events, and set up alerts for measurements that may fall outside of the plant’s preset limits. The software also easily connects to the plant DCS via protocols such as Modbus and OPC, as well as connections to pilot ignitors via traditional I/O relay modules.
