# UNIT PACKAGING REQUIREMENTS

PROPER USE

Thermal Recommendations:

Life of electrolytic capacitors is significantly affected by temperature. It is strongly recommended to keep their temperature 5 to 10°C below the max allowed values in the table under worst case condition especially without active air flow. The reliability of the power supply is affected by higher temperatures as increasing the thermal stress on the components will lead to shorter product life.

Even if power transformer and inductors offer enough thermal margin from maximal allowed temperature, their temperature can reach 130°C and must be considered carefully while placing other system components close to it.

For proper worst-case verification, use low line input voltage 85 VAC 50 or 60Hz with highest load at 40°C. Place thermocouples to listed components on a non-conductive area to measure excessive temperatures and to determine correct system thermal design.

Caution! Some components are located on the primary side of AC-DC power supply! Use appropriate safety measures as these components are at hazardous voltage levels. Thermal couples need to be electrically isolated. Only qualified personnel should attempt to make these measurements. See derating characteristics section for further details.

Installation and Safety:

The power supplies with high power conversion efficiency rely on convection cooling in the surrounding environment (air) to prevent overheating or excessive component temperatures. Therefore, there needs to be adequate access to ambient air to ensure proper thermal performance of the power supply.

Do not exceed the power rating of the product with respect to input voltage and environment temperature of the unit.

The base plate of Class I models is a heat spreader and typically connected to protective earth, it is electrically safe but be aware it may be hot during operation.

The base plate of Class II models is a heat spreader but floating, it is electrically safe but be aware it may be hot during operation.

In some designs the additional heatsinks might not be connected to the base plate. These heatsinks might be electrically connected to components on the hazardous primary side and be at elevated potential with respect to ground. Avoid direct electrical connection between the heat sinks in such case.

The output return of the power supply is by default floating with respect to safety/earth ground (not connected to protective earth).

A non-electrically conductive insulator should be placed between the unit and any conductive surface close to its top or sides to ensure minimal creepage clearance according to the safety standard. If an insulator is not possible, increase these distances to at least 8 mm (0.315”) from any components or leads to keep safety clearance.

Use a proper mating connector for connection on the input and output connectors of the power supply. Refer to the connector information.

For better EMI performance avoid cable routing close to power supply especially near magnetics (transformers or inductors) or switching components. If that is not possible, consider shielding cables of the power supply. If improved radiated emissions performance is needed, small ferrite cores can be added to the input or output cable. Contact local SLPE application engineer for support.

If the system requires an additional EMI filter, carefully consider properly choosing system EMI filters. That can make EMI worse if not properly selected.

# FEATURES

Power vs. Ambient Temperature

Both Class I and Class II versions of power supplies are capable to provide rated maximum power under airflow. However, at some applications cooling fans are not allowed due to higher IP ratings or where audible noise is a concern. In these systems the design still allow loads up to 70% of maximum rated power in a convection cooled environment up to 50°C. At higher temperatures, refer to the power derating section to avoid activation of the internal Over Temperature Protection (OTP) which shuts down the power supply during excessive temperature excursions. The overtemperature protection is based on an “auto-recovery” principle. See the Proper Use and Thermal Considerations sections of this document.

Class B Conducted and Radiated EMI performance margins

AE understands the difficulties to pass the EMC/EMI tests during the development of any product. The interference with electromagnetic emissions and increasing amount of product with wireless communications makes it difficult more than ever to remain within the targeted EMI margins. Typical power supply is designed to pass EN55032 Class B and FCC part 15 Class B with typical margin of 6db for conducted emissions (CE) and with typical margin of 3db for radiated emissions (RE). The final enclosure of the system might add additional radiation shielding and is dependent on the type of system. See performance data section of this document for CE/RE plots.

Active or Passive Inrush Current Limit

Selected series power supplies are designed with an active circuit to limit inrush current to values as low as 15 A @ 264 VAC. This feature allows the system designers better protection against stressing of components and less risk to trip circuit breakers. A typical design of the power supply is equipped with a passive inrush current limiting peak inrush current to approximately 75 A at a reduce product cost. Contact AE representative to review inrush current modification of any selected product.

# UNIT PACKAGING REQUIREMENTS

FEATURES

Safety and BF Isolation Type Rated

This family complies with BF requirements by providing 2 Means of Patient Protection (2 MOPP) from input to output and 1 MOPP between output and ground to avoid electrical shock for Class I units. All models are CE marked to Low Voltage Directive and approved to AAMI ES/CSA C22.2 No./ IEC 60601-1, 3.1rd Edition. Please contact the application engineering team for CE/UL certificates or CB reports if not found on the SLPOWER.COM website for this product.

BF type isolation is referenced in safety standard IEC 60601-1 to define patient applied part classification. BF means Body Floating which must provide a higher degree of protection against electric shock than that provided by type B applied parts. Systems with type BF applied parts allow patient’s body to be at floating electrical potential and complying with the specified requirements of standard IEC60601-1. Due to lower values of allowable leakage current in medical power supplies, it is important to substantially reduce the capacitances that cause leakage currents. Reducing their value can severely reduce the EMI filter's effectiveness.

Operation at Higher Altitude Above Sea Level

For applications at higher sea level the designer should take in account the effect of air pressure on the power supply. SLPE typically designs power supplies that allow to use the units at altitudes up to 5000 m above sea level. This is with respect to air clearance between the components on the PCB following the multiplication factor as described in IEC 60601-1 8.9.1.5 – ME Equipment rated for high altitudes. However, considering the thermal performance of the power supply at altitudes above 2000 m the cooling efficiency drops due to lower air density. Paschen’s law explains this effect in more detail: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paschen%27s_law. Whether natural convection or active airflow, the dissipated heat transfer from power supply is less effective at higher altitudes and must be considered.

Designed to Meet IEC 60601-1-2 4th Edition EMC requirements

The 4th edition of standard IEC60601-1-2 for EMC requirements was released for NA and EU. Most significant change of the standard is harmonization with IEC60601-1-11 to classify medical devices into three main groups, professional healthcare facility environment, home healthcare environment which is more stringent and desires more attention of system designers and special environment.

It is important to note that IEC 60601-1-2 4th edition, is the EMC standard and not to be confused with safety standard IEC 60601-1 3rd edition. While a system must be approved to IEC 60601-1-2 standard a power supply is just part of it therefore certification is given at the system level. However, as some of the tests are directly related to functionality of the power supply, its design takes into consideration the IEC 60601-1-2, 4th Edition EMC requirements.

Output Ripple and Noise

Typical output noise and ripple limits are defined to 1% of the output voltage. Noise measurements are made with noise probe directly at the end of 15cm twisted pair wires terminated with a 0.1 uF ceramic and 10 uF electrolytic low ESR capacitors. Use a short tip oscilloscope voltage probe when making the measurement. This is required to eliminate measurement error due to impedance imbalance errors introduced by the scope probe ground lead length. Values will be higher at ambient temperatures below 0°C. Consult the product datasheet prior to assessing the output ripple and noise measurement results.

# TERMINOLOGY & DEFINITIONS

IEC

The IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission) is an international body that sets safety standards for the electrotechnology space. The Class I and Class II input designations refer to the internal construction and electrical insulation of a power supply. These standards were developed to protect the user from electric shock.

Class I / II / III

IEC Class I input models have basic insulation and must incorporate a protective earth (ground) connection to mitigate the risk of electric shock. Class I input power supplies have a 3-pin input, line (L), neutral (N) and ground (PE or FG).

IEC Class II input models feature additional safety precautions such as double insulation or reinforced insulation, thereby eliminating the need for a protective earth (ground) connection. Class II input power supplies have a 2-pin input, line (L) and neutral (N).

IEC Class III equipment is defined in some standards where protection against electrical shock relies on the voltage being less than 60 VDC of 42.4Vac_pk referred to as Safety Extra Low Voltage (SELV). Generally, these are battery power or power from a SELV power source.

Type B, Type BF, Type CF applied parts

Applied Part – Part of the medical equipment designed to or likely to physically contact the patient.

|Applied Part|Description|
|---|---|
|Type B|(Body) applied part - Not suitable for direct cardiac applications.|
|Type BF|(Body Floating) applied part - A higher degree of protection, not suitable for direct cardiac applications.|
|Type CF|(Cardiac Floating) applied part - The highest degree of protection, suitable for direct cardiac applications.|

Leakage Current, Patient Leakage Current

Leakage current is the current that flows through the protective ground conductor to ground. In the absence of a grounding connection, it is the current that could flow from any conductive part or the surface of non-conductive parts to ground if a conductive path was available such as a human body.

Earth Leakage Current: Is the current that flows through the ground conductor of the line cord back to the ground.

Enclosure Leakage Current: Is the current that flows from any part of the enclosure through a person and back to ground is touched by a person.

Patient Leakage Current: applies to medical devices and is the current that flows through a person to ground having an applied part by applying an unintended voltage from an external source.

Single Fault Condition, Normal Condition

Safety standards dictate the requirements for products to remain safe during the normal operating condition (NC) of the product as well as during an abnormal single fault condition (SFC). Examples for SFC are insulation short circuit, open circuit of protective earth or interruption of any one supply conductor.

Isolation and HI-POT

All of the world's safety agencies require a Dielectric Withstanding Voltage test (also known as a HI-POT or Electric Strength test). This test is used to determine the adequacy of the equipment's insulation mechanisms to protect against electrical shock. The HI-POT test is a test of the insulation surrounding the primary circuits. It involves the application of a high voltage from the primary circuit to the grounding (earth) circuit and to the low-voltage secondary circuits. The potential used for each test is pre-determined by the applicable safety standard. It is based on the AC input voltage, the grade of insulation used in the equipment and the accessibility of the secondary voltages.

Continuous Operation vs. Peak Power

The typical applications can be divided to at least three main categories of power requirements. The first would be a system with electromechanical components like motors or pumps. Such devices require nominal power for standard operation and higher power for the initial movements. The momentum of the motor or pump often requires significantly higher input current which can trigger the over current protection if the power supply was not selected properly. The second category is the battery charger with the maximum power required for empty battery state and low to medium power requirement for others. In such systems the designer considers the average power requirement and calculates the time for the thermal relaxation period in case of empty battery where the power supply is required to provide maximum power at the beginning and then decrease slowly till the battery is completely charged. In both these categories the power supply dimension is depending on average or peak power requirements. The other category covers power supply designs for continuous operations in which the rated power is required for long period of time.

# TERMINOLOGY & DEFINITIONS

Grounding

A power supply can have three types of accessible grounds. Each of these ground connections has dedicated purpose to maintain within safety requirements or electrical characteristics stated in datasheet. Do not mix usage of these electrical contacts.

|Functional Ground (FG)|Also marked as GROUND on AC input. The enclosure of power supply is directly connected to this electrical potential. Floating FG of the power supply may affect electromagnetic characteristics of the unit.|
|---|---|
|Protective Earth (PE)|Marked as GROUND on AC input. Same as FG, the enclosure of power supply is directly connected to this electrical potential. While FG is mainly used to improve the EMI performance of the power supply, PE connection requires in addition safety relevant compliance like maximum permissive PE resistance or minimum current conductivity of several amps defined by safety and in different regions worldwide.|
|Output Return|Marked as (-) on DC output. Isolated from AC input, rated as SELV. This electrical potential is floating with respect to protective earth.|
|Signal return|Marked as GND on the signal connectors. This electrical potential is a reference voltage for digital signals and control features on the power supply such as 5V standby, DC_OK, AUX, ACI, VCI etc.. Shorting of this node to other ground may feed common mode noise into the control system and distort the functionality of digital control or feedback loop.|

Primary and Secondary Circuit of a Power Supply

The input part of the power supply is the so-called front-end block or primary side. It contents a rectification stage and an active power factor correction stage to minimize AC mains current distortion and generate a stable energy storage point for further power conversion. This is the block to look at for wide input AC voltage range along with good power factor correction, low harmonics distortions and high efficiency. The controller on the primary side of AC-DC power supply monitors voltage and current changes depending on network and load condition and control power switching devices as part of the power conversion process. This block is hazardous for potential electrical shock. Specific safety standards such as 60601-1 or 62368-1 usually require the output voltage to be isolated from hazardous electrical circuits. This type of protection is achieved by adhering to creepage and clearance distances between primary front-end circuitry and secondary output circuitry after the isolation circuitry of the power supply. By controlling the switching frequency or pulse width of power devices across the transformer, while using several techniques, the isolated DC-DC conversion allows power transmission to the load.

IEC/EN/CSA/ANSI/AAMI ES60601-1, 3rd Edition, Amendment 1

To govern the design of medical equipment, the International Electrotechnical Committee (IEC) has produced a standard to control all aspects of safety directly or indirectly relating to the handling, use or connection to, of medical equipment. This standard is referenced as IEC 60601, or simply referred to as IEC 601.

IEC61010-1

Safety Requirements for Electrical Equipment for Measurement, Control, and Laboratory Use.

UL8750

Safety Standard for LED Lighting. The standard covers LED equipment that is part of a luminaire or other lighting equipment operating in the visible light spectrum.

Class 2, UL1310

These requirements cover indoor and outdoor use for Class 2 power supplies, LED drivers, and battery chargers. The UL1310, Class 2 standard sets limits on the source with limited voltage and energy capacity.

Certified Body Scheme (CB Report)

The CB Scheme is a vast international arrangement established by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) for mutual acceptance of safety test reports among participating certification organizations in the field of electrical and electronic equipment.

UL94 Enclosure Flame Rating

|HB|Slow-burning on a horizontal specimen; burning rate < 76 mm/min for thickness < 3 mm or burning stops before 100 mm.|
|---|---|
|V-2|Burning stops within 30 seconds on a vertical specimen; drips of flaming particles are allowed.|
|V-1|Burning stops within 30 seconds on a vertical specimen; drips of particles allowed as long as they are not inflamed.|
|V-0|Burning stops within 10 seconds on a vertical specimen; drips of particles allowed as long as they are not inflamed.|

Insulation and Isolation

Operational/Functional: Insulation for correct operation of equipment.

Basic Insulation: Insulation to provide basic protection against electric shock.

Supplementary Insulation: Independent insulation applied in addition to basic insulation to ensure protection against electric shock in the case of a failure of basic insulation.

Double Insulation: Insulation that includes both basic and supplementary insulation.

Reinforced Insulation: Provides a single insulation system that offers a degree of protection against electric shock equivalent to double insulation.
