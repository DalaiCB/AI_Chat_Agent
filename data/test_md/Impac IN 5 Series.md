# OPTICS

Optics for IN 5: The pyrometers are equipped ex works with one of the specified optics.

Each optic is focused at a certain distance (main measuring distance). At these distances, each lens achieves its smallest spot size. Normally the spot size will increase at any other distance (shorter or longer).

For each optic, some example values for measuring distance (measured from the front of the lens) and spot size are listed in the table. Keep this in mind when considering the mounting position of the pyrometer as well as the size of the measuring object (the measuring object must be at least as big as the spot size).

# REFERENCE NUMBERS
