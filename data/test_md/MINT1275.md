Current Sharing/Remote Sense

The output of N+1 (N = 1, 2 ... 5) models can be shared. It is shown in Figure 3, one load-share controller is required for each model and circuits are identical when N+1 identical models are used.

Terminals J302 and J303 are connected to the Vo+ and Vo-, respectively, of the first power model. The Vo+ and Vo- correspond to the other models positive and negative output bus to the load. The J201 pin 1 and pin 3 connects to the S+ and S-, respectively, of the first power models. The S+ and S- correspond to the other models J201 pin 1 and pin 3. The S+ connects to positive output bus and S- connects to negative output bus.

Remote Sense< 250mV drop compensation:

The J201 Pin 4 connects to current sharing bus that it connects to other models J201 pin 4.
