TREK PD05034

High voltage power amplifier for industrial and research applications featuring an all-solid-state design for wide bandwidth, high slew rate, and low-noise operation.

The Trek® PD05034 is a DC-stable, high voltage power amplifier that features an all-solid-state design for high slew rate, wide bandwidth, and low-noise operation. The four-quadrant, active output stage sinks or sources current into reactive or resistive loads throughout the output voltage range. This type of output is essential to achieve an accurate output response and high slew rate demanded by a variety of loads such as highly capacitive or reactive loads. It is configured as a non-inverting amplifier.

|Temperature|0 to 40°C (32 to 104°F)|
|Relative Humidity|Up to 85%, non-condensing|
|Altitude|Up to 2000 meters (6561.68 ft.)|

# Features

|High-Voltage On/Off|Local: Individual push-button switch Remote (TTL compatible input): TTL high (or open) turns off high voltage output. TTL low turns on high voltage output.|
|---|---|
|Dynamic Adjustment|Graduated one-turn panel potentiometer is used to optimize the AC response for various load parameters|
|Current Limit/Trip|Switch selectable for either limit or trip. Graduated one-turn panel potentiometer is used to adjust limit or trip level from 0 to ±50 mA|
|Out of Regulation Status|Illuminates and a TTL low is provided when unit fails to produce required HV output such as during current limit or short circuit conditions|
|Trip Status|Illuminates and a TTL low is provided when the high voltage output is disabled due to the output current exceeding the current trip level, the detection of a high voltage supply fault or the removal of the top cover|
|Fault Status|A BNC provides a TTL low when the Trek PD05034 is out of regulation for greater than 100 ms|
