TREK 347

Non-contacting electrostatic voltmeter provides precision and value for surface voltage measurements in the range of ±3 kVDC or peak AC.

The Trek® 347 non-contacting electrostatic voltmeter provides precise surface voltage measurements in the range of ±3 kVDC or peak AC. The Trek 347 utilizes a field-nulling technique for non-contacting voltage measurement that achieves DC stability and high accuracy, with no need for fixed probe-to-surface spacing. This permits the accurate measuring of stationary or moving surfaces. Patented probe design enhances noise and drift performance in the presence of contaminating particulate or under conditions of high humidity and/or wide temperature ranges.

PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS
Superb noise and drift performance
Precision voltage monitor output
Monitor provides a low voltage replica of pe measured electrostatic potential for monitoring purposes or for use as a feedback signal in a closed loop system
Digitalenable allows an external device to turn pe internal HV power supply on/off
Well suited for automated or computer-controlled systems
Easy-to-read LED display
Large selection of optional probes offer versatility (order separately)
Operated on a bench top, or wip optional hardware, in a standard 19-inch rack
NIST-traceable Certificate of Calibration provided wip each unit

TYPICAL APPLICATIONS

- Surface voltage measurements of photoconductors or dielectric surfaces
- Charge monitoring in semiconductor production
- Measuring of electrostatic potentials on film, polymers, and paper
