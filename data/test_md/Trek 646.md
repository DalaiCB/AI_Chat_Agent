TREK 646

Software-driven electrostatic chuck supply offers an array of features that provide significant benefits while accommodating a variety of demanding applications.

The Trek® 646 software-driven electrostatic chuck supply offers an array of features that provide significant benefits while accommodating a variety of demanding applications. Trek 646 incorporates Advanced Energy technology which has demonstrated increases in efficiency and throughput equal to three times that of other supplies. Virtual elimination of sticky wafer and wafer popping issues ensures better control over particle contamination. Given the versatility and performance of the Trek 646, it can be used in multiple unique tools/processes, thus eliminating the need to specify a new supply for each unique tool/process in a facility.

# TREK 646 ELECTROSTATIC CHUCK SUPPLY

# TECHNICAL DATA

|Environmental Specifications| |
|---|---|
|Temperature|0 to 35°C (32 to 104°F)|
|Relative Humidity|Up to 85%, non-condensing|
|Altitude|Up to 2000 m (6561.68 ft)|

# Features

|Interlock|Connections are provided to support an interlock safety configuration. In the event that the interlock is open, the high-voltage generation circuits are shut down|
