MONROE 282CPS

Charge plate system accessory for Monroe 282 Tidov fieldmeters and a charging source to charge the plate attachment

The Monroe 282CPS is an accessory for the Monroe 282 Fieldmeter that permits the Monroe 282 to measure ionizer performance. The Monroe 282CPS includes a charge plate attachment for the fieldmeter and a charging source to charge the plate attachment. The fieldmeter then measures the plate voltage during balance and decay tests

# PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS

- Lowest-cost test method for periodic verification of ionizers
- Correlates closely to charged-plate monitor test results
- Exceeds current requirements of ESD Assn. SP3.3 for periodic verification of air ionizers
- Performs go/no-go, balance, and decay tests
- Includes dual polarity charger, adapter, and carrying case
- Attaches to Monroe 282 fieldmeter and also works with Monroe 281

EASY-TO-USE OPERATION

Go/no-go Check

1. While away from any ionized airflow, turn the Monroe 282 fieldmeter on and check "zero" reading.
2. Slide the plate assembly onto the Monroe 282 fieldmeter.
3. Select charger polarity by grounding the opposite terminal (Ground "-" to select "+").
4. To charge the plate adapter, place it in contact with the appropriate charger terminal.
5. Position the fieldmeter with the plate adapter in the ionizer airflow. The meter should rapidly drop from 1100 V to zero.

Note: All tests should be performed while wearing a wrist strap to ensure a proper ground.

Decay Rate Check

Follow the steps above, but connect the fieldmeter to chart recorder, or use a stopwatch to measure the time required for the voltage to decay from ±1.00 kV to ±0.10 kV.

Balance Check

Turn on the fieldmeter with the plate adapter attached. Point it into the ionizer airflow, check for an average reading of zero. An offset reading indicates an unbalance.
