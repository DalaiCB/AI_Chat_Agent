TREK 520 SERIES

Portable electrostatic voltmeter for accurate, non-contacting measurements of electrostatic surface voltage for ESD applications in ionized or non-ionized environments.

The Trek® 520 (±2 kV) and Trek 523 (±20kV) hand held electrostatic voltmeters that utilize a measurement technique that overcomes the disadvantage of the typical hand held field meter by providing surface voltage measurements which are essentially independent of the sensor probe-to-measured surface spacing. The Trek 520 is available in two versions. The 520-1 has a digital meter to display the measured voltage. The 520-2 has an analog output monitor in addition to the digital display. This analog output monitor can be used to record the measured voltage or to view it on an oscilloscope.
