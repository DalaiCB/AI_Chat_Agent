# AXA SERIES

25 Watts

Advanced Energy's Artesyn AXA series of low-input isolated DC-DC converters features an ultra wide 4:1 input voltage range of 9–36 Vdc and is designed primarily for use with nominal 12 V or 24 V supplies. There is a choice of five single output models, offering voltages of 3.3 V, 5 V, 12 V, 15 V or 24 V, and two dual output models offering +12/-12 V or +15/-15 V. The converters are fully encapsulated in a compact 1 x 1 inch (25.4 x 25.4 mm) metal case incorporating an isolated baseplate and have a height of just 0.4 inch (10.2 mm). An optional clip-on heatsink is available for convection cooling. Standard features include 1,500 Vdc input/output isolation, remote On/Off and hiccup mode short-circuit protection
