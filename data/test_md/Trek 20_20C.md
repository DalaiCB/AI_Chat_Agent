# TREK 20/20C

High voltage power amplifier with an all-solid-state design for high slew rate, wide bandwidth, and low-noise operation for industrial and research applications.

The Trek® 20/20C is a DC-stable, high voltage power amplifier used in industrial and research applications. It features an all-solid-state design for high slew rate, wide bandwidth and low-noise operation. The four-quadrant, active output stage sinks or sources current into reactive or resistive loads throughout the output voltage range. This type of output is essential to achieve an accurate output response and high slew rate demanded by a variety of loads such as highly capacitive or reactive loads. It is configured as a non-inverting amplifier.

# PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS

Four-quadrant output for driving capacitive loads
Closed loop system for high accuracy
Short-circuit protected for equipment protection
All solid-state design for maintenance-free operation
DC-stable for programmable supply applications

# TREK 20/20C HIGH VOLTAGE POWER AMPLIFIER

# TECHNICAL DATA

Features:

- High Voltage On/Off
- Local: Individual push-button switches
- Remote: TTL compatible input. TTL high (or open) turns off high voltage output. TTL low turns on high voltage output.
- Dynamic Adjustment
- Graduated one-turn panel potentiometer is used to optimize the AC response for various load parameters
- Current Limit/Trip
- Switch selectable for either limit or trip. Graduated one-turn panel potentiometer is used to adjust limit or trip level from 0 to ±20 mA
- Out of Regulation Status
- Illuminates and a TTL low is provided when unit fails to produce required HV output such as during current limit or short circuit load conditions
- Trip Status
- Illuminates and a TTL low is provided when the high-voltage output is disabled due to the output current exceeding the current trip level, the detection of a high-voltage supply fault or the removal of the top cover
- Fault Status
- A BNC provides a TTL low when the Trek 20/20C is out of regulation for greater than 500 ms
