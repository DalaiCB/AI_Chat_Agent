Fastest Arc Response in Industry — Least Arc Damage

Pinnacle series DC power supplies store less than 1 mJ per 1 kW of output for the shortest arc recovery time in the industry. With a hard-arc detection time of 0.5 to 3 μs, they are approximately ten times faster than competing units. Process interruption is negligible. Hard arc shutdown from full power results in power interruption of less than 10 μs.

Configurable Arc Response

Sophisticated arc-handling capabilities enable you to easily program voltage trip level, delay to shutdown, and shutdown time to match your process. For additional ease, Pinnacle series units automatically implement preset process values when you select your target type (metal or nonmetal).

Maximum Process Efficiency

With the highest efficiency and power factor in the industry, the Pinnacle platform offers both the lowest operating and installed cost.

|No Tap Changes, Wide, Full-Power Tap|Pinnacle units deliver a full-power tap over a 6.25:1 impedance range — without tap changes. Competitive supplies have a gap in coverage with little overlap, and may only cover a 2.87:1 range by changing among three manual taps. The standard-Z version of the Pinnacle platform delivers full output into loads requiring 400 to 1000 VDC. If you don’t need full output, the range of available load impedances is even wider. Further, several low-Z options are available for full power below 400 VDC.|
|---|---|
|Minimized Conditioning Time for New Targets|Target conditioning cycle (TCC) mode ensures the shortest conditioning time by limiting output power based on arc rate and average power delivered.|
|Low-Ripple Technology|The elimination of high-voltage switches and current-diversion circuits results in superior reliability, as well as superior process performance in the form of high output-voltage consistency and a highly accurate, fast ramp response.|

Precise Process Control

A variety of innovative features maximize process control:

- Joule mode enables you to set delivered energy during each process run and adjusts for ramp time and lost energy during arc events.
- User-selectable and programmable parameters put process control at your fingertips:
- Selectable operation as a power, current, or voltage source
- Programmable ramp/run recipes
- Programmable process limits for output level as well as strike and process voltage

16-bit control circuitry enables the fastest, most accurate ramp-to-set point response in the industry.

Non-volatile memory stores and preserves recent settings in case of an unexpected shutdown.

Compact, Versatile Package

Pinnacle supplies require only 3U for either a single 20 kW unit or two 10 kW power supplies. Single-output 3 kW, and 12 kW units, as well as dual-output 6 kW and 10 kW units, are also available. Flexible master/slaving allows up to 200 kW of output in only 30U. Six kW and 12 kW units can be configured together in a master/slave arrangement, as well as can 10 kW and 20 kW units. Any unit is easily designated as either master or slave, making units of the same configuration interchangeable.

Display/Control Options

The Pinnacle platform offers the following options:

- Active front panel or remote panel. Either option offers complete unit control, with adjustable settings for joule mode, output limits, ramp/run recipes, and arc response.
- Passive front panel. Allows visual monitoring by an operator.
- Multiple I/O protocols. Allow you to adjust settings as with an active remote panel. Analog selections are available in isolated and non-isolated 15- and 24- VDC configurations. Digital selections include AE Bus (RS-232, RS-422, RS-485), Profibus, and DeviceNet™.
