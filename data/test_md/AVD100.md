# ARTESYN AVD100 SERIES 100 - 120 Watts

Advanced Energy's Artesyn AVD100 series of sixteenth-brick isolated DC-DC converters comprises two single output models offering fully regulated voltages of 5.0 V or 12 V, rated at 20 amps, 10 amps respectively. Both of the converters have a wide 2:1 input range of 36 to 75 Vdc and are designed primarily for use with standard 48 V telecommunications equipment supplies. Rated at 100 watts, they employ an open-frame construction, offer up to 91% full load efficiency and accommodate an ambient operating temperature range of -40 to 85˚C. A baseplate option is available for enhanced thermal performance. The converters use 250 kHz fixed frequency switching to minimize the need for external EMI filtering.
