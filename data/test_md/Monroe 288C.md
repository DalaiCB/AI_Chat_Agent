# MONROE 288C

Easy-to-use charge plate monitor for manual and automated testing with internal data storage

The Monroe 288C is the first charged plate monitor to incorporate a microprocessor and data storage, eliminating the need for a dedicated computer. All test parameters are programmable allowing tests to be optimized and not dictated by equipment limitations. Once programmed, the Monroe 288C will perform a series of tests automatically: decays, balance, balance peaks, temperature, humidity, time/date are stored and may be reviewed via the display or downloaded to a PC. The included software allows the user to define and name ionizer locations, test setups, and sequences and then upload these to the CPM. All of these features result in a flexible, easy-to-use instrument that facilitates audits while minimizing errors.

# TREK 288C OPERATION

The Trek 288C performs manual or automatic decay and balance tests on critical ionization equipment and stores the results and averaged decay times for up to 600 workstations. Temperature and relative humidity are displayed real-time and recorded with the test data. All pertinent test information is presented on a large format LCD display. Custom protocols and personal workstation definitions can be uploaded and results downloaded for analysis via a bi-directional USB link. In decay mode, the plate is charged to a predetermined voltage from ±10 to ±1000. During the test, the plate will discharge toward zero in the presence of ionization. The elapsed time of decay between the start voltage and a preset stop voltage, as low as zero volts, is displayed. In balance mode, isolated plate voltage, test duration, and ± peak voltages are displayed. Self-tests include battery check, tests for functional errors, and a built-in decay self-confidence check.

# PLATE ASSEMBLY

The 6 x 6 in (15 x 15 cm) plate assembly includes a detachable ground plane that is used for improved consistency in decay readings. Built-in self-test resistor for function confidence check is also incorporated. (Optional 1 x 1 in or 3 x 3 in plate assemblies are available.) Small diameter (3 mm) low noise coaxial cable is used for interconnection to the main unit.
