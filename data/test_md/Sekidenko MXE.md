# SEKIDENKO MXE

Temperature control is increasingly critical in a variety of applications. The MXE pyrometer is ideally suited to measure temperature in tightly controlled applications where uniform, repeatable measurements are required.

# HIGHLY CONFIGURABLE PLATFORM

The MXE pyrometer is configurable to suit a variety of applications. Features such as measurement wavelength, active reflectance, optical interface, and I/O protocols can be optimized for a specific application. Measurements up to 10 kHz are possible.

In addition, a variety of spot sizes and working distances can be supported. Use of fiber-coupled collection optics can also be supported for applications requiring remote placement of the electronics.

# ACCURATE, REPEATABLE PERFORMANCE

High-speed measurement allows collection of multiple data points and ensures statistically significant temperature determination. Moreover, built-in compensation algorithms allow stable operation over the full ambient temperature range for repeatable and consistent measurement.

# COMPREHENSIVE MEASUREMENT CAPABILITIES

Temperature control is increasingly critical in a variety of applications. The MXE pyrometer is ideally suited to measure temperature in tightly controlled applications where uniform, repeatable measurements are required.

# INCREASED PROCESS INSIGHT

Measurement wavelength can be selected specifically for the target and temperature range of interest, ensuring optimal results. Reflectance is also available, allowing for emissivity-corrected measurements on opaque targets.
