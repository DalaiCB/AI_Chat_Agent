# TREK 157

Charged plate monitor that offers better accuracy, stability, and bandwidth than conventional designs.

The Trek® 157 combines patented precision charge measurement capability with features that drive down ionizer maintenance and performance testing costs. Enhanced features, such as those that enable the operator to store and retrieve data as data points or graphs and record operator comments for reference, make the Trek 157 ideal for use in dissipative testing of materials and monitoring of static charge.

# PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS

- Customizable measurement capacitance provides assurance that ESD process needs are met in manufacturing and that there is conformance to ANSI/ESD-STM3.1 and IEC61340-5-1 standard test methods
- Greater bandwidth enables “true” responses to be observed by avoiding the masking of results which can occur with other vendors’ systems
- Extremely low offset and drift ensures high accuracy, making it ideal for applications requiring critical ion balance such as GMR and TMR manufacturing areas
- Compact and lightweight, for easy portability within a facility
- NIST-traceable Certificate of Calibration provided with each unit

# AT A GLANCE
