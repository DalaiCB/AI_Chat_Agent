# MONROE 282H

Pocket-sized, easy-to-use 200 kV non-contacting static meter which produces consistently accurate readings.

# Digital Stat Arc 3

MONROE

The Monroe 282H 200 kV/cm range digital Stat-ArcTM fieldmeter is a pocket-sized, non-contacting static meter for consistently accurate readings. Simply hold the instrument so the range finder LED beams from a non-pulsing circle indicating you're at exactly the right distance from the target for readings up to 2000 V.

# HIGHLIGHTS

- 200 kV range
- Exclusive Auto-Zero circuit
- Hold button captures transient readings
- Chopper-stabilized measurement technique works in the presence of ionization
- Recorder output and 40-hour battery
- Drift-free accuracy even in ionized environments
- Optional Charge Plate System for testing ionization systems

# PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS

|Normal Range|0 to ±199.9 V @ 1 ft|
|---|---|
|Accuracy|±5% of reading, + zero offset, ±2 LSD|
|Response Time|80 to 100 msec, 10 to 90%|

# TYPICAL APPLICATIONS

- Monitoring "static-free" electronic workstations
- Measuring static build-up on webs in converting, laminating, and printing operations
- Checking grounds and bonding in dry particle/power transport systems

MONROE ELECTROSTATIC FIELD METER 282H

EASY-TO-USE OPERATION

1. Turn the instrument ON.
2. Discharge your body by touching a grounded metal object.
3. Point the aperture toward a grounded object and press the ZERO button.
4. Aim the aperture toward the target surface at a distance of 1ft. Adjust the distance until the flashing beams of the LEDs in the instrument converge. Read the voltage and polarity of the charged surface on the meter display. For additional measurements, repeat step four.

Maintenance

The battery should be replaced annually, whenever you plan an extended period of unattended monitoring, or whenever "BAT" appears on the display for more than an instant. To obtain accurate and drift-free readings, the sensor plate and especially the area around the aperture must be kept absolutely clean at all times. Never touch the aperture with anything—not even a cotton swab.
