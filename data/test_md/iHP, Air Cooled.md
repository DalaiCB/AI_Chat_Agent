# ARTESYN MODULAR HIGH POWER SYSTEM

Up to 24000 Watts iHP12 iHP24

Designed for a wide range of medical, industrial, lighting/horticulture and semiconductor applications, Advanced Energy’s iHP configurable precision power system provides accuracy, resolution and stability as either a programmable voltage or current source. It provides up to 24 kW in 3 kW increments and can be configured for up to 8 outputs using a wide variety of plug-in modules that address a large range of voltages and currents.

Safety approvals secured by Advanced Energy eliminate the need for an isolation transformer in medical equipment. The iHP power system also has industrial safety approvals, including compliance to the SEMI F47 standard for semiconductor processing equipment.

The iHP power system offers developers either an analog or digital interface to their system supporting standard communications protocols, while a software graphical user interface (GUI) allows for easy configuration and user dashboard creation. For horticulture customers, detailed scheduling and control software is available. For non-medical applications, a smaller and lighter rack is now available using the same plug-in modules.

# Cooling and Audible Noise

<65 dBA with 80% load @ 30 °C at nominal input voltage with Smart Fan algorithm to be optimized based on module and rack thermal sensors. When modules are inhibited via software control, the fan speed is reduced to idle and acoustic noise is <46 dBA. With modules off via front panel switch fans are at idle for 1 min, and off for 9 min.

# Ingress Protection

Fan Cooled = IP20

# Pollution Degree

2

# RoHS Compliance
