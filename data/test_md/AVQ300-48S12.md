# ARTESYN AVQ300 SERIES

300 Watts

Advanced Energy's Artesyn AVQ300 series quarter-brick DATA SHEET isolated DC-DC converter is designed specifically to provide a regulated low noise 12 Vdc output for feeding downstream non-isolated point-of-load (POL) converters in systems with distributed power architectures (DPA). The converter has a wide 2:1 input range of 36 to 75 Vdc and is designed primarily for use with standard 48 V telecommunications equipment supplies. Rated at 300 watts, it can deliver up to 25 amps and accommodates a wide ambient operating temperature range of -40 to 85˚C.

# SPECIAL FEATURES

- 2:1 wide input range
- Optimized for high density, small space applications
- Low ripple and noise
- Fixed switching frequency
- High efficiency
- High capacitive load capability
- Basic insulation system
- Openframe structure with baseplate option

# SAFETY

- TUV/CE 62368-1
- UL/cUL 60950-1
