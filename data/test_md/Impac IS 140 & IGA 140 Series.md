# SIGHTING OPTIONS

For exact aiming to the object, different alignment systems are available:

- Laser targeting light: the laser targeting light is a red laser beam used to align the pyrometer to a target. The laser marks the center of the measuring spot. The laser targeting light can be used during operation without effecting the measurement.
- Through lens view finder: the view finder can be used to align the measured object through direct observation. The view finder is true-sided and parallax-free; a circle marks the position of the measuring area.

PROFIBUS, PROFINET, AND ETHERNET INTERFACE

Alternatively to the RS232/RS485 interface, the pyrometers are also available with built-in Profibus-DP (PB types), Profinet (PN types) or Ethernet (ET types) interface. The PB and PN types can easily be integrated in existing Profibus and Profinet systems, respectively.

The GSD (Profibus) and GSDML (Profinet) files are part of standard delivery and offer a selection of five different module configurations corresponding to your requirements. The project planning can be done with any project tool.
