# eVoS ME

Asymmetric bias waveform generator for direct control of substrate voltage and ion energy

The eVoS™ ME asymmetric bias waveform generator is designed to achieve direct control of wafer-surface voltage and resulting ion energy distributions (IED) in plasma-based etch and deposition processes. The eVoS system comprises an agile high voltage power supply combined with innovative asymmetric waveform generating technology to establish and control wafer surface potential. The asymmetric output of the eVoS eliminates the limitations and restrictions of wafer biasing inherent to sinusoidal RF bias applications. Fast digital metrology and novel control algorithms enable the production of near mono-energetic IEDs.
