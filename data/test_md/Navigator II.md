Customers gain access to critical process information through various available serial and analog I/O interfaces, including RS-232, Profibus, Ethernet, and DeviceNet® interfaces.

# RF SECTION

Real-Time Measurement, Analysis, and ControlOptional Virtual Front Panel (VFP)AE’s VFP software enables you to monitor and command the matching network through a user’s computer. It also passively monitors unit functions and can actively control tuning and match parameters, featuring event monitoring, readbacks, Smith® charting, and password-controlled access.Optional Z’Scan II RF SensorThe Z-Scan® II RF sensor provides real-time measurement of process power and impedance, enabling data-driven decisions for establishing, assessing, and troubleshooting tool, process, and product states. It also helps minimize process variability by gathering and using RF data as a multi-variate indication of system problems (plasma striking, mis-tuned network, and more).
