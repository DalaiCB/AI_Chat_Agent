# SIGNAL CONNECTOR - J2

1. Power Good: Output signal - J2 Pin 6

During normal operation is Logic High, goes HIGH 100 mS to 250mS after main output is in regulation, and goes LOW with 7 mS warning time before loss of main output due to loss of AC input. Note: Power Good signal is a combination of AC OK (Internal) and DC OK such that failure of either one will cause the Power Good signal to go low. Logic High: > 4.5V sourcing 16 mA; Logic Low: < 0.5V sinking 16 mA.

2. DC OK: Output signal - J2 Pin 10

During normal operation, this signal is logic High. It will go logic Low for output less than 90% of its nominal rated voltage. Logic High: > 4.5V sourcing 16 mA; Logic Low: < 0.5V sinking 16 mA.

3. Enable: Input signal - J2 Pin 9

Logic High or Open = On, Low/Ground = Off. Logic High > 3.4V, logic low < 1.2V. Internal pull up resistor: 43kΩ to 5V.

4. PS Off: Input signal - J2 Pin 8

Logic Low or Open = On, logic High = Off. Logic High > 3.4V, logic low < 1.2V. Internal pull up resistor: 43kΩ to V-.

5. Remote Sense Output Signal - J2 Pin 1 (+Sense), J2 Pin 2 (-Sense)

Less than 250 mV voltage drop compensation due to cable loss on each side of main output.

6. Standby Output - J2 Pin 5 (+), J2 Pin 4 (-)

The standby output is always available when AC input is present. It is rated for 5V/0.2A.
