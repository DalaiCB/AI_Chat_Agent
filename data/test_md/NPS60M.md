Advanced Energy's Artesyn NPS60-M series of open-frame AC-DC power supplies comprises four single output models, offering voltages of 5 V, 12 V, 15 V or 24 V. All four models feature ITE and medical safety approvals and are equipped with dual AC fuses. The power supplies have a a typical full load efficiency of 87% and a no-load power consumption of less than 300 mW. The series is primarily designed for use in information technology equipment (ITE) and light industrial systems, as well as for equipment intended for non-patient contact and non-patient critical use in low power medical, dental and laboratory applications.
