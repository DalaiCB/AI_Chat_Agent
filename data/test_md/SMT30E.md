# ARTESYN SMT30E SERIES E-Class Non-Isolated

Advanced Energy's Artesyn SMT30E series non-isolated DC-DC converter accepts an 8 to 14 Vdc input and produces an output that can be trimmed over a very wide 0.8 to 3.63 Vdc range to satisfy a broad diversity of semiconductor power needs. Rated at 99 watts, the converter has a typical efficiency of 91% and can deliver up to 30 amps. Standard features include remote On/Off, remote sense and comprehensive protection against short-circuit and overtemperature conditions. Packaged as a low profile surface-mount module, it has a 0.53 x 1.3 inch (13.5 x 33 mm) footprint and an installed height of only 0.32 inch (8.2 mm).

# SMT30E

OUTPUT VOLTAGE ADJUSTMENT

The ultra-wide output voltage trim range offers major advantages to users who select the SMT30E-12W3V3J. It is no longer necessary to purchase a variety of modules in order to cover different output voltages. The output voltage can be trimmed in a range of 0.8 Vdc to 3.63 Vdc. When the SMT30E-12W3V3J converter leaves the factory the output has been adjusted to the default voltage of 0.8 V.

Notes:

1. The SMT30E features a ‘Positive Logic’ Remote ON/OFF operation. If not using the Remote ON/OFF pin, leave the pin open (the converter will be on). The Remote ON/OFF pin is referenced to ground. The following conditions apply for the SMT30E:

|Configuration|Converter Operation|
|---|---|
|Remote pin open circuit|Unit is ON|
|Remote pin pulled low [Von/off < 0.8 V]|Unit is OFF|
|Remote pin pulled high [Von/off >2.8 V]|Unit is ON|

A ‘Negative Logic’ Remote ON/OFF version is also possible with this converter. Please consult the factory for details.
2. NOTICE: Some models do not support all options. Please contact your local Artesyn representative or use the on-line model number search tool at http://www.artesyn.com to find a suitable alternative.

A. The derating curve represents the condition at which internal components are within the Artesyn derating guidelines.

B. Characteristic data has been developed from actual products tested at 25 °C. This data is considered typical data for the converter.
