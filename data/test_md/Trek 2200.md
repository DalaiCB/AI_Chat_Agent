# TREK 2200 SERIES

High voltage power amplifiers/piezo drivers with all-solid-state output stages, DC offset adjustment, and auto-recovery shutdown for overpower protection.

The Trek® 2200 series offers three high voltage 40 W amplifiers models. Provided at a competitive price and offering high performance, the units incorporate DC stability, wide bandwidth and well regulated/controlled AC output signals. It also features full four-quadrant class AB all-solid-state output stages, DC offset adjustment with front panel metering, and auto-recovery shutdown to protect the output from being overpowered. The instrument sinks or sources current into reactive or resistive loads throughout the output voltage range making it ideal to achieve the accurate output response and high slew rates demanded by reactive loads.

2 The output cable supplied with this instrument uses a coaxial cable that has 30.8 pF/ft of capacitance at 1 kHz nominal. This cable capacitance must be factored in as a portion of the load and will reduce slew rates and large signal bandwidth. In applications that require maximum performance it is suggested that the supplied high voltage coaxial cable be kept as short as possible to reduce capacitance. Another option is to cut the coaxial cable short and add two break out leads (one for shield [ground] and one for the center conductor) for the connection to load.
