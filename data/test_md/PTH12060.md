# ARTESYN PTH12060

12 Vin Single Output

Advanced Energy's Artesyn PTH12060 series of non-isolated DC-DC converters complies with the Point-of-Load Alliance (POLA) standard. The converters offer some of the most advanced POL functions in the industry, including Auto-Track™ sequencing for controlled power-up/power-down of complex semiconductor devices such as DSPs, FPGAs and ASICs, and voltage margining. Standard features include pre-bias startup, input undervoltage lockout, remote On/Off and auto resetting short-circuit protection.

There are two models in the PTH12060 series of converters, both of which have an input voltage range of 10.8 to 13.2 Vdc. One model offers an output voltage that can be trimmed from 0.8 to 1.8 Vdc, the other has an output that can be trimmed from 1.2 to 5.5 Vdc, enabling a broad diversity of semiconductor power needs to be satisfied. The 0.8 to 1.8 V output converter offers up to 88% efficiency while the higher output voltage model can achieve up to 94%. Both converters are rated at 55 watts output power and can deliver up to 10 amps. Available in through-hole horizontal mount and surface-mount versions, they have a small 0.62 x 0.99 inch (15.7 x 25.3 mm) footprint and an installed height of just 0.35 inch (9 mm).

# PTH12060

OUTPUT VOLTAGE ADJUSTMENT

The ultra-wide output voltage trim range offers major advantages to users who select the PTH12060. It is no longer necessary to purchase a variety of modules in order to cover different output voltages. The output voltage can be trimmed in a range of 1.2 Vdc to 5.5 Vdc for suffix ‘W’ and 0.8 Vdc to 1.8 Vdc for suffix ‘L’. When the PTH12060 converter leaves the factory the output has been adjusted to the default voltage of 1.2 V for the PTH12060W and 0.8 V for the PTH12060L.

**Efficiency Table: PTH12060W (Io = 8 A)**
|Output Voltage|Efficiency|
|---|---|
|Vo = 5.0 V|94%|
|Vo = 3.3 V|92%|
|Vo = 2.5 V|90%|
|Vo = 2.0V|88%|
|Vo = 1.8 V|87%|
|Vo = 1.5 V|85%|
|Vo = 1.2 V|83%|

**Efficiency Table: PTH12060L (Io = 8 A)**
|Output Voltage|Efficiency|
|---|---|
|Vo = 1.8 V|88%|
|Vo = 1.5 V|87%|
|Vo = 1.2 V|84%|
|Vo = 1.0 V|82%|
|Vo = 0.8 V|79%|

Notes:

1. Remote ON/OFF. Positive Logic
- ON: Pin 3 open; or V > Vin - 0.5 V
- OFF: Pin 3 GND; or V < 0.8 V (min - 0.2 V).
2. See Figures 1, 2 and 3 for safe operating curves of PTH12060W and Figures 6, 7 and 8 for safe operating curves of PTH12060L.
3. A 560 μF electrolytic input capacitor is required for proper operation. The capacitor must be rated for a minimum of 800 mA rms of ripple current.
4. An external output capacitor is not required for basic operation. Adding 330 μF of distributed capacitance at the load will improve the transient response.
5. 1 A/μs load step, 50 to 100% Iomax, Cout = 330 μF.
6. If utilized Vout will track applied voltage by ±0.3 V (up to Vo set point).
7. Tape and reel packaging only available on the surface-mount versions.
8. The pk-pk output ripple voltage is measured with an external 10 μF ceramic capacitor. See Figures 5 and 8 for Standard application schematic.
9. NOTICE: Some models do not support all options. Please contact your local Artesyn representative or use the on-line model number search tool at http://www.artesyn.com to find a suitable alternative.
