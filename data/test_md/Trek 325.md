TREK 325

Highly sensitive versatile instrument for highly accurate, low noise, and non-contacting measurement of electrostatic voltages of 0 to ±40 V.

The Trek® 325 electrostatic voltmeter is a versatile instrument used for performing noncontacting electrostatic voltage measurements in applications which include contact potential (surface work function) determination, materials evaluation and electret studies. The Trek 325 was specifically designed for high sensitivity applications to allow highly accurate, low noise, non-contacting measurement of electrostatic voltages of 0 to ±40 V over a wide range of probe-to-surface distances. Special features of the Trek 325 allow adjusting the performance of the unit to compensate for specific test conditions. A calibrated null voltage supply of 0 to ±10 volts nulls measured surface contact potential when measuring voltages on test surfaces. High Speed of Response

PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS

# TECHNICAL DATA

Probe

During operation, the metallic surfaces of the probe are driven to voltage levels equal to the measured surface voltage value, therefore, the probe holding fixture must be of an insulating material of 7 11 approximately 10 to 10 ohms/square. Phenolic or other dissipative type material is recommended to avoid any fixture charge retention.

|Probe-to-Surface Separation|0.2 mm to 2 mm (recommended)|
|---|---|
|Trek PD1216P Sensor Probe| |
|Aperture Orientation|10:1 of the measured voltage or 20:1 of the measured voltage (switch selectable)|
|Aperture Size|5 mA.|
|Probe Body Type|0.1 W, nominal.|
|Dimensions (D x L)|10 x 56 mm (0.4 x 2 in).|
|Probe Cable Length|2743 ±127 mm (9 ft ±5 in).|
