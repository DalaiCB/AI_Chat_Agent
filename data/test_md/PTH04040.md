# ARTESYN PTH04040 3.3 / 5.0 Vin Single Output

Advanced Energy's Artesyn PTH04040 series non-isolated DC-DC converter complies with the Point-of-Load Alliance (POLA) standard. It offers some of the most advanced POL functions in the industry, including Auto-Track™ sequencing for controlled power-up/power-down of complex semiconductor devices such as DSPs, FPGAs and ASICs, and voltage margining. Standard features include pre-bias startup, programmable input undervoltage lockout, differential remote sense, remote On/Off and auto resetting short-circuit protection.

PTH04040 series converters have an input voltage range of 2.95 to 5.5 Vdc and an output voltage that can be trimmed from 0.8 to 2.5 Vdc to meet a wide variety of semiconductor power needs. Rated at 150 watts, the converters offer up to 93% efficiency and can deliver up to 60 amps. Available in through-hole horizontal mount and surface-mount versions, they have a small 1 x 2 inch (26.5 x 52 mm) footprint and an installed height of just 0.35 inch (9 mm).

# PTH04040

OUTPUT VOLTAGE ADJUSTMENT

The ultra-wide output voltage trim range offers major advantages to users who select the PTH04040W. It is no longer necessary to purchase a variety of modules in order to cover different output voltages. The output voltage can be trimmed in a range of 0.8 Vdc to 2.5 Vdc. When the PTH04040W converter leaves the factory the output has been adjusted to the default voltage of 0.8 V.

**Efficiency Table (Io = 45 A; Vin = 5 V)**
|Output Voltage|Efficiency|
|---|---|
|Vo = 1.2 V|86%|
|Vo = 1.5 V|88%|
|Vo = 1.8 V|90%|
|Vo = 2.5 V|93%|

Notes:

1. The set-point voltage tolerance is affected by the tolerance and stability of RSET. The stated limit is unconditionally met if RSET has a tolerance of 1% with 100 ppm/ºC or better temperature stability.
2. This control pin has an internal pull-up to Vin nominal. If it is left open-circuit the module will operate when input power is applied. A small low-leakage (&lt;100 nA) MOSFET is recommend for control. For further information, consult Application Note 192.
3. A 1000 μF input capacitor is required for proper operation. The capacitor must be rated for a minimum of 400 mA rms of ripple current.
4. This is with a 1 A/μs loadstep, 50 to 100% Iomax. Co = 660 μF.
5. The minimum input voltage is 2.95 V or 1.34 x Vo, whichever is greater.
6. These are default voltages. They may be adjusted using the ‘UVLO Prog.’ control input. Consult Application Note 192 for further details.
7. See Figures 1 and 2 for safe operating curves. All power pins must be used.
8. A small low-leakage (&lt;100 nA) MOSFET is recommended to control this pin. The open-circuit voltage is less than 1 Vdc.
9. NOTICE: Some models do not support all options. Please contact your local Artesyn representative or use the on-line model number search tool at http://www.artesyn.com to find a suitable alternative.
