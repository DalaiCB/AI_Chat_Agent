# IMPAC IN 5/5

Compact pyrometer for temperature measurement of glass and quartz glass surfaces. Temperature ranges between 100 to 2500°C (212 to 4532°F).

# AT A GLANCE

The Impac® IN 5/5 infrared thermometers are specially designed for non-contact temperature measurements of glass surfaces and quartz surfaces. This instrument is a digital pyrometer in two-wire technique. This technique combines the high accuracy of the digital signal processing with the simple connection and operating with two wires. The solid and robust design of the instruments guarantees high operational safety even in rough industrial environments. For optimal match of the instrument to the application (size of the measuring object, distance), different optics are available.

# OPTICS

The pyrometers are equipped ex works with one of the specified optics. Each optic is focused at a certain distance (main measuring distance). At these distances, each lens achieves its smallest spot size. Normally the spot size will increase at any other distance (shorter or longer).

For each optic, some example values for measuring distance (measured from the front of the lens) and spot size are listed in the table. Keep this in mind when considering the mounting position of the pyrometer as well as the size of the measuring object (the measuring object must be at least as big as the spot size).

When measuring the temperature of very large and hot surfaces (for example by the float glass production), additional radiation is received by the pyrometer’s detector due to unavoidable effects (diffraction, multiple reflection). These effects increase the temperature output. To get correct temperature values in this case, the pyrometer must be prepared ex works. The effect will be compensated by "float glass calibration."

|Optics|Measuring Distance a [mm]|Spot Size M90 [mm]|
|---|---|---|
|100|2.5|2.5|
|200|18|13|
|300|35|24|
|300|6|6|
|600|22|17|
|1000|45|32|
|1200|24|24|
|2500|50|43|
|4000|80|65|

The determination of the main spot size "M" in the main measuring distance "a" occurs at 90% measuring signal.
