# MIKRON M330

High temperature blackbody calibration source with temperature range of 300 to 1700°C (572 to 3092°F).

The Mikron® M330 is a blackbody calibration source utilizing a digital indicating temperature controller that may be set to any temperature between 300 and 1700°C (572 and 3092°F). A precision thermocouple controls the blackbody cavity providing high accuracy and repeatability. A closed-end tube with a 25 mm (1”) aperture diameter is heated by specially manufactured elements. The temperature controller uses the industry standard PID algorithms to control the emitter temperature to within ±0.5°C.

# OVERVIEW

Blackbody calibration sources are infrared radiators used for calibrating and verifying the output signals of infrared thermometers (pyrometers), thermal imaging systems, heat flux measurement systems, or spectrographic analysis systems. Advanced Energy supplies a unique selection of very precise calibration sources that are traceable to national standards. Quotations for custom designs and variations are available upon request.

Mikron calibration sources have long been the gold standard to calibrate the instruments that keep your operations up and running. These blackbodies are superior because of the emissivity values, homogeneous emission areas, and a wide range of different sized apertures to adapt to the desired target area. In addition, fast heat-up times and high temperature stability are guaranteed. The quality of our calibration sources is guaranteed by tests, burn-in times, and radiometric calibrations. On most models, a certificate is provided to document the traceability to the international temperature scale ITS90 and NIST.

The M330 blackbody uses a resistive heater that provides long life. (Running at temperatures greater than 1600°C for long periods will shorten heater life.) An independent over-temperature power cutout system is an added safety feature. An internal fan keeps the cabinet surfaces at a safe, comfortable temperature.
