The Models 2340/2350 are designed for applications that require high-voltage amplification beyond the standard voltage limitations of most waveform, function, or pulse generators.

With a maximum output voltage of 400 Vp-p, the Models 2340/2350 come standard with a fixed gain of +50. Gains from 10 to 100 are available by special order.

Each channel is rated for 40 mA continuous current with 0.2 Ω output impedance. Each channel has an independent, buffered, voltage monitor output for applications that require a low-level representation of the output signal. The buffers produce a reduction of 200:1 for 50 Ω inputs and 100:1 for 1 MΩ and above inputs.

The output current is sensed in both directions by the current limit function. This provides maximum protection to the amplifier during operation. A built-in power supply monitor protects the power amplifiers by tracking the DC power supply. If a high-voltage DC fault occurs, the monitor will disconnect the power supply from the power amplifiers. Cycling the supply power resets the fault. The amplifiers can drive capacitive loads up to 200 pF while maintaining a full power bandwidth exceeding 200 kHz.

For maximum user safety, the outputs are grounded to the instrument chassis to prevent accidental voltage loops. A binding post is provided on the front panel for a direct chassis ground connection.

The Models 2340/2350 are cost-effective solutions for specialized applications where low distortion and precise signal amplification is required. These units are particularly suited for high frequency, electrostatic applications that require high voltage.

Figure 1: Small Signal Frequency Response (Typical)
Amplifier Gain measured with 900 mV peak-to-peak input.
Amplifier Frequency Response (-3 dB) at 2 MHz.

Figure 3: Maximum Vpp vs. Frequency
Amplifier’s maximum peak-to-peak output roll off with frequency.
This is due to the amplifier’s slew rate of 250 V/μSec.

Figure 2: Small Signal Frequency Response (Typical)
Amplifier Gain measured with 900 mV peak-to-peak input. Same as Figure 1 but Y-axis is Volts instead of dB.

Figure 4: Distortion (Typical)
Distortion measurements were made operating the amplifier at 75 % of the maximum Vpp output obtained from Figure 3.
