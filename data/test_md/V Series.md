# ULTRAVOLT V SERIES

VERTICAL, MICRO-SIZED HIGH VOLTAGE BIASING SUPPLIES

Advanced Energy

The vertical, micro-sized V series is the ideal solution for applications that require a bias voltage ranging from 0 to 3000 V and very small current, at only 13.8 cc (0.84 in3). With a footprint under 2.54 cm2 (1 in2), these modules are perfect for applications with limited board space.

# PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS

- 0.5, 0.8, or 1 W of output power
- Tight line/load regulation
- Arc and continuous short circuit protection
- Self-restoring output voltage
- Low cost, miniature, and lightweight
- Voltage monitoring
- Low ripple (0.01% peak to peak)
- Optional flying lead for high-voltage output
- UL/cUL recognized, IEC-60950-1, CE Mark (LVD and RoHS)
