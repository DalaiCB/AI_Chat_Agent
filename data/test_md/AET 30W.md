# ARTESYN AET SERIES 25 - 30 Watts

Advanced Energy's Artesyn AET series of 25-30 watt isolated DC-DC converters is available with an ultra wide 9–36 Vdc or 18–75 Vdc input. Each of these versions offers a choice of five single output models, with voltages of 2.5 V, 3.3 V, 5 V, 12 V or 15 V, and two dual output models offering +12/-12 V or +15/-15 V. The converters are encapsulated in 2 x 1.6 inch a metal case and have a height of just 0.48 inch. They are ideal for ruggedized applications involving harsh environments. Standard features include 1,500 Vdc input/output isolation, overvoltage protection and short-circuit protection with auto-restart.
