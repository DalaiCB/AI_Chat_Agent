# INNOVA 1314i

OVERVIEW

Gas selectivity for the Innova 1314i monitor is achieved through the use of optical filters. By installing up to five filters, the 1314i can measure the concentration of up to five component gases and water vapor in any air sample. The detection limit is gas-dependent, but is typically in the ppb region.

The monitoring system is easily operated through either the front panel, with its push-buttons and display providing short explanatory texts, or through the PC software. Both methods allow the user to configure the monitor, start a measurement sequence, and view the resulting concentration values of specific gases.

Reliability is ensured by a series of self tests performed by the monitor. The self tests check software, data integrity, and the 1314i’s components to ensure that they function properly. If a fault is found, it is reported in the measurement results, so that the integrity of the results can be ensured.

The 1314i measurement system requires no consumables and very little regular maintenance. For most applications, recalibration is only necessary one to two times a year.

The monitor is equipped with standard interfaces: USB, Ethernet, and RS232. These enable the monitor to be integrated into automated process systems.

To ensure easy placement of the 1314i, it is housed in a rugged box that fits in a standard 19 inches rack and has a built-in pump system that allows samples to be drawn from up to 50 meters away.

# INNOVA 1314i

# MEASURING DETAILS

Selectivity
The gas selectivity of the 1314i is determined by the optical filters installed in its filter wheel. Because water is nearly always present in ambient air and absorbs infrared light at most wavelengths, it contributes to the total acoustic signal in the analysis cell. Therefore, the monitor is permanently fitted with a special filter that measures water vapor and enables the 1314i to compensate for water vapor interference. By selecting different filters, this technique can also be used to cross-compensate for known interferent gases.

Calibration
After the relevant optical filters are installed, the monitor must be calibrated. This is achieved through easy-to-use menu driven instructions. Thanks to its high stability, calibration of the 1314i is seldom necessary more than once a year. Calibration is performed using either the Calibration Software BZ7002 or directly from the 1314i's front panel.

Operation
The 1314i monitoring system is easy to operate using either the application software or by using the front panel push-keys (which can be locked and accessed at three levels using passwords). The monitor can be operated as both an online and offline instrument (i.e. standalone operation). Using these user-interfaces with their logical division of information, everything that needs to be defined is achieved prior to starting the monitoring task.

Configuring the Monitor
The set-up option enables all the parameters necessary to complete the monitoring task to be defined. This includes setting the Sample Integration Times (S.I.T.) option, which enables measurement results to be weighted - sensitivity against speed. When used as a system controller for multipoint monitoring, the same menu enables the setup of the Innova 1409’s multipoint sampling tasks.

Starting Measurements
Once the set-up parameters have been defined, measurements can be started immediately or later using a delayed start time. Once started, the monitoring task continues until it is stopped either manually or by using a defined stop time.

Measurement Cycle
1. The pump draws air from the sampling point through the air filter to flush out the “old” air in the measurement system and replace it with a “new” air sample. The pressure sensor is used to check that the pump sequence is elapsed successfully and to measure the actual air pressure.
2. The “new” air sample is hermetically sealed in the analyses cell by closing the inlet and outlet valves.
3. Light from an infrared light source is reflected off a mirror, passed through a mechanical chopper, which pulsates it, and then through one of the optical filters in the filter wheel.
4. The gas being monitored selectively absorbs the light transmitted by the optical filter. Because the light is pulsating, the gas temperature increases and decreases, causing an equivalent increase and decrease in the pressure of the gas (an acoustic signal) in the closed cell.
5. Two microphones mounted in the cell wall measure this acoustic signal, which is directly proportional to the concentration of the monitored gas present in the cell.
6. The filter wheel turns so that light is transmitted through the next optical filter, and the new signal is measured. The number of times this step is repeated is dependent on the number of gases being measured.
7. The response time is approximately 13 seconds for one gas or water vapor, or approximately 26 seconds if five gases and water vapor are measured.

Alarms
Two alarm trigger levels, which provide high alarm limits for each measured gas, can be defined. These can also be linked to audible alarms using the relay outputs. In addition, the application software allows four alarm levels to be displayed.

Maintenance
The only maintenance tasks necessary are calibration and replacement of the air filter. Both tasks are easily performed. The frequency for changing the air filter depends on the individual applications.

# MEASUREMENT DATA

Online Measurement Results

Using one or more of the monitor’s standard interfaces, measurement results are transferred directly to a PC. Here the results can be displayed on screen as real-time values in tables and graphs (see Fig. 1) or integrated into the process system.

In the 7820/7880 software, the graphs can be configured to display only the desired gases, defined concentration ranges, and results from statistical analyses. Also, when using the 7880 software, all measurement data is stored in user-defined SQL Server 2014 database.

Uploaded to the BZ7003 Offline Software in either excel or text file format or alternatively printed out on a standard printer.

Remote Control Option

Advanced Energy offers remote control capability through the user’s local area network using the LumaSoft Gas Single Point 7820 or Multi Point 7880 software. Online access to the measurement data is available via a built-in OPC server (alternatively via Microsoft Excel).

Optional Analog/Relay Interface Module UA1374

The functions of the 1314i can be expanded through the additional Analog/Relay Module UA1374. For each gas, barometric pressure, and chamber temperature, the following outputs are available:

0 to 20 mA, 4 to 20 mA
0 to 10 V (0 to 5 V with loss of dynamic range)

Fig. 1: The graphical window shows up to seven graphs. The user selects the data plotted, the scaling, and the style and color of the lines and background to build the graphical window.

Offline Measurement Results

Gas measurement result data is displayed on the 1314i’s screen (display memory) as soon as it is available and is constantly updated. During a task, the 1314i performs running statistical analyses of the measured gas concentrations, calculating a variety of values for each monitored gas.

This data (in Display Memory) can be copied to the Background Memory, which is a non-volatile storage area. The internal memory stores the measurement readings on a gas per gas basis, but also across the sampling channels when applicable.

Data stored in Background Memory can be recalled to Display Memory. From this memory, data can be

|Accuracy|Zero Drift: ±0.25%|
|---|---|
|Voltage Output:|±1.5% of full scale|
|Current Output|± 0.5% of full scale|
|Resolution|16 bit (0 to 20 mA and 0 to 10 V)|
|Measurement Range|Range and zero-point are scalable in the software. Maximum load resistance on current output is 800 Ω. Minimum load resistance for the voltage output is 1000 Ω.|

The analog outputs are galvanically isolated from the rest of the analyzer, but NOT from each other.

With the Analog/Relay Interface Module, 12 alarm relays can be configured: either as two alarm levels for each gas (plus water) on any active sampling channel, or as alarm relays for selective channels on any monitored gas. Furthermore, two alarm relays are available for warning/error messages and for system watchdog function. Max 25 V DC, Max 100 mA.

Purge Module

The 1314i can be fitted with a “sealed box” which ensures that the measurement system inside the 1314i can be purged using an inert gas.

# INNOVA 1403 - LUMASENSE Technologies

Reliable and easy-to-use multipoint sampler and doser

The Innova® 1403 Multipoint Sampler and Doser is designed to be remote-controlled from a PC using a USB interface with an Innova 1512 or 1412i Photoacoustic Gas Monitor to provide a flexible, sensitive, and accurate monitoring system. The 1403 greatly increases the area monitoring capabilities of the gas monitor by drawing air samples through tubing from up to six sampling points, up to 50 m away, and delivering the samples to the gas monitor.

# PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS

# INNOVA 1403

# OVERVIEW

Comprehensive air exchange analysis and ventilation efficiency checks are easily performed using the 1403’s dosing facilities. Tracer gas is delivered through tubing to “label” the air. The amount of tracer gas delivered is automatically calculated by the 1403. The labeled air is then sampled by the 1403 and delivered to the Gas Monitor for analysis.

The 1403 factory calibration and self-checking routines allow for easy verification of the unit’s operation and ensure reliable functioning.

The Innova 1403’s pneumatic system is shown in Figure 1. The sampler system is constructed of AISI-316 stainless steel and poly tetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tubing to minimize absorption of samples. The system has six inlet channels, each with a solenoid valve. Each inlet channel has a tube-mounting stub on the 1403’s front plate. Six tubes of up to 50 m connect each channel to the respective sampling point. The six inlet channels converge into one; a three-way valve then directs the gas sample to the 1512 or the 1412i for analysis or through the pump to the waste-air outlet on the 1403’s backplate. A pressure transducer checks the efficiency of the sampling pump and allows checks for blocked airways. It is recommended that an air filter is attached to the end of each sampling tube to keep the samples free of particles.

Reliability is ensured by automatic self-tests using both hardware and software. A check of the pneumatic system can be performed on request by the controlling computer. The 1403’s operating status is reported to the User Software and any error or warning will be given in a status window on the PC.

# INNOVA 1403

# SYSTEM DETAILS

The Doser System

The doser system has three outlet channels, each with a solenoid valve. Up to three channels can be selected at a time depending on the given dosing task. The flow through the outlet channel is determined by the Mass Flow Controller (MFC) and is controlled by the User Software. Calibration data for SF6 and Freon 134a is stored in the User Software.

The dosed amount is determined by the MFC setting. The dosing-gas inlet is pressurized by the tracer gas supply cylinder, which is connected by tubing to the inlet on the 1403’s backplate.

Ventilation measurements by controlling both hardware and software in the Innova 1403 Multipoint Sampler and Doser and the Innova 1512 or 1412i Gas Monitor. The user sets up the sampler and the doser unit by selecting up to six sample channels and one out of three doser channels.

Dosing can be either of type pulsed injection for decay measurements or of type constant dose for flow measurements. Measurement is run automatically and the measurement results are presented in numerical and graphical curve views. A graphical curve view is shown in Figure 2.

The carrier-air inlet pumps extra air to the dosing outlets to speed delivery of the tracer gas to the dosing point. This inlet has a coarse air filter, a pump, and a pressure transducer for checking the efficiency of the pump. Delivering a dose of tracer gas to a dosing point 50 m distant takes one minute. The dosing system can deliver an uninterrupted flow of tracer gas over a period of time. If communication between the system components fails, the selected doser valve will be closed after 60 s.

Calibrating the Doser System

The 1403 is factory calibrated for SF6 and Freon 134a. By selecting the correct gas, the amount of tracer gas delivered during a dosing procedure can be accurately determined by the Mass Flow Controller in the 1403.

Control of the 1403

The 1403 is fully remote-controlled from a PC using the 7650 Basic Ventilation Software or the 7651 Advanced Ventilation Software. Via the software, the controlling computer communicates with the Gas Monitor over the USB interface. Commands and information requests are sent over the interface to the 1403 to control the sampler system; to setup, and control the dosing system; and to read-out data and command the performance of self tests.

7650 Basic Ventilation Software

The Innova 7650 Basic Ventilation Software allows full coordination and control of all the dosing/sampling and monitoring functions of such systems. The 7650 can control one 1512 or 1412i and a 1403 unit. The 7650 Basic Ventilation Software is able to perform

7651 Advanced Ventilation Software

The optional 7651 Advanced Ventilation Software adds the possibility to use the Constant Concentration Method. It also adds the possibility to use up to three dosing valves when using the Decay or the Constant Concentration Method. The user can select measurement results for further processing by marking a range of measurements in the curve display with two vertical cursors. The marked measurements can be used to calculate parameters like Age of Air, Air Exchange and others.

System Use

The 1403 combined with the 1512 or the 1412i and a controlling computer with 7650 or 7651 Application Software offers wide ranging monitoring capabilities. The 1403 makes it possible to perform air exchange analysis and multi-point monitoring tasks in many different situations and environments, without changing the system components. An example air exchange analysis system is shown in Fig. 3. In such a system, the doser/sampler systems of the 1403 are used as follows. The doser system marks the supply air of the room with a known amount of tracer gas. The sampler system then takes a sample of the return air from the room, and delivers the sample to the Gas Monitor for analysis. While the Gas Monitor performs one analysis, the 1403 takes the next sample for analysis from the room. As the amount of tracer gas delivered to the room is known, and the remaining concentration of tracer gas in the samples is determined by the Gas Monitor, the ventilation system performance can be calculated.

# INNOVA 1409

# OVERVIEW

The sampling system is configured from the system controller: either directly via the front panel interface of the gas monitor, or using one of the available software (BZ7007 or LumaSoft 7880). The 1409 communicates with the gas monitor over a USB interface. When using LumaSoft 7880 as a system controller, the computer is connected to the gas monitor via the RS232 serial, USB, or Ethernet interface.

The pneumatic system of the 1409 is shown below. The sampler system is constructed of AISI-316 stainless steel and PTFE (poly-tetrafluoroethylene) tubing to minimize adsorption of samples. The system has 6 to 24 inlet channels depending on the configuration. Each inlet channel has a tube mounting stub on the backplate of the 1409 to connect each channel to the respective sampling point. The 24 inlet channels converge into one; a three-way valve then directs the gas sample to the gas monitor for analysis, or through the external pump (optional) via the waste-air outlet on the 1409’s backplate.

The highly efficient 1409’s sampler system transports gas samples from the sampling point at approximately four meters per second. This speed depends on the type of pump, the diameter of the tubing, and the length of tubing attached to the 1409. An air filter is attached to the end of each sampling tube to keep the 1409 free of particles.

# INNOVA 1409

# MEASURING DETAILS

Control of the 1409

The 1409 is remotely controlled either by using the gas monitor as a system controller (the monitoring/sampling system then operates in standalone mode), or by LumaSoft 7880 Multipoint Software running on a computer connected to the gas monitor and communicating over the RS232, USB, or Ethernet interface. Commands and information requests are sent over the USB interface to the 1409 to control the sampler system and to read-out data.

System Use

The 1409 combined with a gas monitor offers wide-ranging monitoring capabilities. The 1409 makes it possible to perform multipoint monitoring tasks in a variety of situations and environments, without changing the system components. Air samples are drawn from up to 24 sampling points and delivered to the monitor. The monitor can then measure the concentrations of up to five gases, water vapor, and air pressure in each sample. With its design with a set of 3-way valves, the 1409 sampler can be equipped with an optional external pump: while the gas monitor analyzes the active channel, the system can already sample gas from the next channel in the sequence order.

Setting Up the Sampling Task

The selection of the active channels can be done either directly via the front panel interface of the gas monitor, or using one of the available software (7880 and BZ7007). The 7880 software enables to customize the sampling sequence across the active channels.

Standalone Multipoint Monitoring

Innova Photoacoustics Gas Monitors (1512, 1314i, 1412i, and 3434i) can be setup as a system controller. Their internal CPU is then synchronizing the sampling and gas measurement tasks; it stores the measurement readings in the internal memory on a gas per gas basis, and across the active sampling channels. A monitoring system which, via tubing, can perform gas-monitoring tasks in up to 24 different locations. When a user sets up a measurement task using the software, the task is performed automatically and measurement data is collected and displayed on the screen. Measurement data is stored in an SQL Server 2014 database, providing easy access to measurement data during a measurement task. The user also has online access to measurement data from Microsoft Excel while a task is running. This makes the data readily available to produce tailor-made reports.

Reliability

Reliability is ensured by automatic self-tests of both hardware and software. The 1409’s operating status can be read-out at any time.

Alarm Features

When operating in online multipoint monitoring with LumaSoft 7880, software alarms can be defined for each gas on each channel. In standalone operation with the 1314i Photoacoustic Monitor, alarm relays can be configured as an option, either for each gas on any channel or for selected channels on any gas.

# INNOVA 1512

OVERVIEW

Gas selectivity for the Innova 1512 monitor is achieved through the use of optical filters. By installing up to five filters, the 1512 can measure the concentration of up to five component gases and water vapor in any air sample. The detection limit is gas-dependent, but is typically in the ppb region. In addition, the 1512 has a built-in pump system that allows samples to be drawn from up to 50 meters away.

Accuracy of these measurements is ensured by the 1512’s ability to compensate for temperature and pressure fluctuations, water vapor interference, and interference from other gases known to be present. Reliability is ensured by a series of self tests performed by the monitor. The self tests check software, data integrity, and the 1512’s components to ensure that they function properly. If a fault is found, it is reported in the measurement results, so that the integrity of the results can be ensured. This measurement system requires no consumables and very little regular maintenance. For most applications, recalibration is only necessary one to two times a year.

The monitoring system is easily operated through either the front panel, with its push-buttons and display providing short explanatory texts, or through the PC software. Both methods allow the user to configure the monitor, start a measurement sequence, and view the resulting concentration values of specific gases.

The monitor is equipped with standard interfaces: USB, Ethernet, and RS232. These enable the monitor to be integrated into automated process systems.

# INNOVA 1512

# MEASURING DETAILS

Selectivity
The gas selectivity of the 1512 is determined by the optical filters installed in its filter wheel. Because water is nearly always present in ambient air and absorbs infrared light at most wavelengths, it contributes to the total acoustic signal in the analysis cell. Therefore, the monitor is permanently fitted with a special filter that measures water vapor and enables the 1512 to compensate for water vapor interference. By selecting different filters, this technique can also be used to cross-compensate for known interferent gases.

Calibration
After the relevant optical filters are installed, the monitor must be calibrated. This is achieved through easy-to-use menu driven instructions. Thanks to its high stability, calibration of the 1512 is seldom necessary more than once a year. Calibration is performed using either the Calibration Software BZ7002 or directly from the 1512 front panel.

Operation
The 1512 monitoring system is easy to operate using either the application software LumaSoft Gas 7820 or 7880 or by using the front panel push-keys (which can be locked and accessed at three levels using passwords). The monitor can be operated as both an online and offline instrument (i.e. standalone operation). Using these user-interfaces with their logical division of information, everything that needs to be defined is achieved prior to starting the monitoring task.

Configuring the Monitor
The Set-up option enables all the parameters necessary to complete the monitoring task to be defined. This includes setting the Sample Integration Times (S.I.T.) option, which enables measurement results to be weighted - sensitivity against speed. When used as a system controller for multipoint monitoring, the same menu enables the setup of the Innova 1409’s multipoint sampling tasks.

Starting Measurements
Once the set-up parameters have been defined, measurements can be started immediately or later using a delayed start time. Once started, the monitoring task continues until it is stopped either manually or by using a defined stop time.

Measurement Cycle
1. The pump draws air from the sampling point through the air filter to flush out the “old” air in the measurement system and replace it with a “new” air sample. The pressure sensor is used to check that the pump sequence is elapsed successfully and to measure the actual air pressure.
2. The “new” air sample is hermetically sealed In the analyses cell by closing the inlet and outlet valves.
3. Light from an infrared light source is reflected off a mirror, passed through a mechanical chopper, which pulsates it, and then through one of the optical filters in the filter wheel.
4. The gas being monitored selectively absorbs the light transmitted by the optical filter. Because the light is pulsating, the gas temperature increases and decreases, causing an equivalent increase and decrease in the pressure of the gas (an acoustic signal) in the closed cell.
5. Two microphones mounted in the cell wall measure this acoustic signal, which is directly proportional to the concentration of the monitored gas present in the cell.
6. The filter wheel turns so that light is transmitted through the next optical filter, and the new signal is measured. The number of times this step is repeated is dependent on the number of gases being measured.
7. The response time is approximately 13 seconds for one gas or water vapor, or approximately 26 seconds if five gases and water vapor are measured.

Alarms
Two alarm trigger levels, which provide high alarm limits for each measured gas, can be defined. These can also be linked to audible alarms using the relay outputs. In addition, the application software LumaSoft Gas 7820 or 7880 allows four alarm levels to be displayed.

Maintenance
The only maintenance tasks necessary are calibration and replacement of the air filter. Both tasks are easily performed. The frequency for changing the air filter depends on the individual applications.

# MEASUREMENT DATA

Online Measurement Results

Using one or more of the monitor’s standard interfaces, measurement results are transferred directly to a PC. Here the results can be displayed on screen as real-time values in tables and graphs (see Fig. 1) or integrated into the process system.

In the 7820/7880 software, the graphs can be configured to display only the desired gases, defined concentration ranges, and results from statistical analyses. Also, when using the 7880 software, all measurement data is stored in user-defined SQL Server 2014 database.

Uploaded to the BZ7003 Offline Software in either excel or text file format or alternatively printed out on a standard printer.

Remote Control Option

Advanced Energy offers remote control capability through the user’s local area network using the LumaSoft Gas Single Point 7820 or Multi Point 7880 software. Online access to the measurement data is available via a built-in OPC server (alternatively via Microsoft Excel).

Optional Analog/Relay Interface Module UA1374

The functions of the 1512 can be expanded through the additional Analog/Relay Module UA1374. For each gas, barometric pressure and chamber temperature, the following outputs are available:

- 0 to 20 mA, 4 to 20 mA
- 0 to 10 V (0 to 5 V with loss of dynamic range)

Fig. 1: The graphical window shows up to seven graphs. The user selects the data plotted, the scaling, and the style and color of the lines and background to build the graphical window.

Offline Measurement Results

Gas measurement result data is displayed on the 1512’s screen (display memory) as soon as it is available, and is constantly updated. During a task, the 1512 performs running statistical analyses of the measured gas concentrations, calculating a variety of values for each monitored gas.

This data (in Display Memory) can be copied to the Background Memory, which is a non-volatile storage area. The internal memory stores the measurement readings on a gas per gas basis, but also across the sampling channels when applicable.

Data stored in Background Memory can be recalled to Display Memory. From this memory, data can be

|Accuracy|Zero Drift: ±0.25%|
|---|---|
|Voltage Output|±1.5% of full scale|
|Current Output|± 0.5% of full scale|
|Resolution|16 bit (0 to 20 mA and 0 to 10 V)|
|Measurement Range|Range and zero-point are scalable in the software. Maximum load resistance on current output is 800 Ω. Minimum load resistance for the voltage output is 1000 Ω.|

The analog outputs are galvanically isolated from the rest of the analyzer, but NOT from each other.

With the Analog/Relay Interface Module, 12 alarm relays can be configured: either as two alarm levels for each gas (plus water) on any active sampling channel, or as alarm relays for selective channels on any monitored gas.

# INNOVA 3433i

OVERVIEW

Gas selectivity for the Innova 3433i monitor is achieved through the use of optical filters. By installing up to five filters, the 3433i can measure the concentration of up to five component gases and water vapor in any air sample. The detection limit is gas-dependent, but is typically in the ppb region.

The monitoring system is easily operated through either the front panel, with its push-buttons and display providing short explanatory texts, or through the PC software. Both methods allow the user to configure the monitor, start a measurement sequence, and view the resulting concentration values of specific gases.

Reliability is ensured by a series of self tests performed by the monitor. The self tests check software, data integrity, and the 3433i’s components to ensure that they function properly. If a fault is found, it is reported in the measurement results, so that the integrity of the results can be ensured.

The 3433i measurement system requires no consumables and very little regular maintenance. For most applications, recalibration is only necessary one to two times a year.

The monitor is equipped with standard interfaces: USB, Ethernet, and RS232. These enable the monitor to be integrated into automated process systems.

To ensure easy placement of the 3433i, it is housed in a rugged box that fits in a standard 19" rack and has a built-in pump system that allows samples to be drawn from up to 50 meters away.

# INNOVA 3433i

# MEASURING DETAILS

Selectivity

The gas selectivity of the 3433i is determined by the optical filters installed in its filter wheel. Because water is nearly always present in ambient air and absorbs infrared light at most wavelengths, it contributes to the total acoustic signal in the analysis cell. Therefore, the monitor is permanently fitted with a special filter that measures water vapor and enables the 3433i to compensate for water vapor interference. By selecting different filters, this technique can also be used to cross-compensate for known interferent gases.

Calibration

After the relevant optical filters are installed, the monitor must be calibrated. This is achieved through easy-to-use menu driven instructions. Thanks to its high stability, calibration of the 3433i is seldom necessary more than once a year. Calibration is performed using either the Calibration Software BZ7002 or directly from the 3433i's front panel.

Operation

The 3433i monitoring system is easy to operate using either the application software or by using the front panel push-keys (which can be locked and accessed at three levels using passwords). The monitor can be operated as both an online and offline instrument (i.e. standalone operation). Using these user-interfaces with their logical division of information, everything that needs to be defined is achieved prior to starting the monitoring task.

Configuring the Monitor

The set-up option enables all the parameters necessary to complete the monitoring task to be defined. This includes setting the Sample Integration Times (S.I.T.) option, which enables measurement results to be weighted - sensitivity against speed.

Starting Measurements

Once the set-up parameters have been defined, measurements can be started immediately or later using a delayed start time. Once started, the monitoring task continues until it is stopped either manually or by using a defined stop time.

Measurement Cycle

|1.|The pump draws air from the sampling point through the air filter to flush out the “old” air in the measurement system and replace it with a “new” air sample. The pressure sensor is used to check that the pump sequence is elapsed successfully and to measure the actual air pressure.|
|---|---|
|2.|The “new” air sample is hermetically sealed in the analyses cell by closing the inlet and outlet valves.|
|3.|Light from an infrared light source is reflected off a mirror, passed through a mechanical chopper, which pulsates it, and then through one of the optical filters in the filter wheel.|
|4.|The gas being monitored selectively absorbs the light transmitted by the optical filter. Because the light is pulsating, the gas temperature increases and decreases, causing an equivalent increase and decrease in the pressure of the gas (an acoustic signal) in the closed cell.|
|5.|Two microphones mounted in the cell wall measure this acoustic signal, which is directly proportional to the concentration of the monitored gas present in the cell.|
|6.|The filter wheel turns so that light is transmitted through the next optical filter, and the new signal is measured. The number of times this step is repeated is dependent on the number of gases being measured.|
|7.|The response time is approximately 13 seconds for one gas or water vapor, or approximately 26 seconds if five gases and water vapor are measured.|

Online Measurement Results

Using the monitor’s standard interface, measurement results are transferred directly to a PC or integrated into the process system.

Maintenance

The only maintenance tasks necessary are calibration and replacement of the air filter. Both tasks are easily performed. The frequency for changing the air filter depends on the individual applications.

# INNOVA 3731

# OVERVIEW

Regulatory frames, like the European F-Gas Directive (EC 517/2014), are mandating the use of leak detection systems in the vast majority of high-voltage SF6-GIS installations in order to better mitigate the risk of SF6 emissions. Specifically, when the existing gas instrumentation is not accurate enough to provide early detection: pressure/density switches used for safety considerations (to prevent catastrophic failure) lack of sensitivity and manual leak checks only provide discrete check points. Instead, stationary leak detection systems enable a permanent monitoring and early warning in the case of a leakage event occurring.

The Innova 3731 system leverages more than 20 years of leadership on the ultra-sensitive photoacoustic sensing technique to provide a direct and integral leak detection solution capable of monitoring large switchgear rooms. The system verifies that the GIS Equipment operates below the industrial target of 0.5% yearly leakage rate or better. The 3731 system can detect—with a short response time—any excessive increase in the leak rate, enabling to decrease the number of periodic leak checks while providing early leak detection.

# Multipoint Sampling

With a multipoint sampler for up to 24 different channels, the 3731 system enables an extensive distribution of sampling points over the whole enclosed substation in order to maximize the coverage area and minimize the detection response time. The length of each individual channel can be extended up to 75 m.

Operation
The Innova 3731 leak detection system operates in standalone mode using the gas monitor as the system controller. It self-synchronizes the monitoring and sampling tasks. The system follows a fixed sampling sequence, measuring the active sampling channels in their basic order. The user can define a fixed interval in between two sequences.

Setting Up the System
The monitor and sampler units are rack-mountable on a standard 19" chassis. The user decides where the measurement points should be located and connects the sampler unit to each location with tubing. A short tubing piece connects the sampler’s outlet to the monitor’s inlet. The units communicate via USB interface.

Offline Measurement Results (Standalone Operation)

LumaSoft 7870 can provide real-time graphical display of the measurements on a channel-per-channel basis.

Gas measurement result data is displayed on the monitor’s screen (Display Memory) as soon as it is available, and is constantly updated.

The online software opens a SQL database to log the measurement values.

The internal database structures the measurement readings on a gas per gas basis, and across the sampling channels. This data in Display Memory can be copied to the Background Memory, which is a non-volatile storage area. Data stored in Background Memory can also be recalled to Display Memory.

From this memory, data can be exported via the Remote/Offline Software in either excel or text file format.

Analog and Alarm Relay Outputs

The 3731 system features an analog/relay module with analog output (0-10 V, or 4-20 mA) for detection trending and 12 configurable alarm relay outputs for more detailed reporting of alarm conditions. Furthermore, two outputs are also available for relaying warning/error flags and for system watchdog function.

In particular, the Channel Mode is useful for multi-zone monitoring applications with the need to alarm on a zone-by-zone basis. Alarm relays are attributed to one or multiple sampling channels (defining a specific zone) and will trigger upon detection of alarm concentration on any of the monitored gas (for that zone). The Remote/Offline BZ7007 software enables the setup of the alarm levels and of the relay module.

Remote Control Option

The 3731 system offers remote control capability through the user’s LAN, USB, or RS232 interfaces using the optional LumaSoft Gas Multi Point 7870 software. This option enables the online monitoring of the leak detection system. The user-friendly interface of the 827007 Remote &nd OMllin =

# INNOVA 3731

# ADDITIONAL SYSTEM DETAILS (CONTINUED)

Reliable by Design

The leak detector’s extended self-test routines maintain the reliability of the results, which are stored in the internal memory of the gas monitor and can be downloaded as required. Alarm relays are available to report any warning/error on the system to the end user.

Detection Trending and Automatic Alarms

Analog output is available for detection trending over time. Measurements are also stored in the internal memory and can be exported to a remote LAN computer via user-friendly software interface. Finally, configurable zone alarms can be relayed to a local RTU.

If the power supply fails, the 3731 system will automatically restart when power is restored. Measurement data stored in the monitor’s memory is not affected by power loss.

Selectivity and Accuracy

The monitor is permanently fitted with a special filter that measures water vapor and enables the monitor to compensate for water vapor interference. Additional auto-compensation for temperature and pressure fluctuations helps to achieve exceptional accuracy.

Low Maintenance

It is only recommended to calibrate the gas monitor only once per year. The calibration can be done without the requirement of an equipment outage. The only other maintenance task necessary is changing the air filter on each active sampling channel.

Calibration
Calibration is performed using either the Calibration Software BZ7002 or directly from the front panel using the easy-to-use menu-driven instructions.

# INNOVA Multi Gas Monitoring Instruments

Application Software for Remote Control of a Photoacoustic Gas Monitor and a Multipoint Sampler and Doser

# Advanced Ventilation Software 7651

- Synchronizes the functions of a Sampler and Doser unit to the measurement cycle of a Gas Monitor
- Flexibility in the choice of tracer gas, SF6 or Freon 134a
- Stores up to five gas concentrations, air humidity and amount of tracer gas delivered
- Enabling all tracer gas methods: concentration decay, constant injection and constant concentration
- Calculates air exchange, age-of-air and air flow in ducts
- Up to nine curves can be shown, allowing direct comparison of results from different locations

The Advanced Ventilation Software 7651 from LumaSense Technologies enables remote control of a 1512 or a 1412i Photoacoustic Gas Monitor and a 1403 Multipoint Sampler and Doser unit. The software coordinates the functions of the instruments to form a monitoring system which, via tubing, can perform ventilation and air exchange measurements. The system can also perform gas-monitoring tasks in up to 6 different locations.

When the user configures a measurement task using the software, the task is performed automatically and the data is collected and displayed on the screen. When the measurement is complete and during measurement, the data processing facilities of the software are used to calculate the parameters that the user requires.

# Getting Started

The Gas Monitor and Sampler and Doser unit are connected to the computer via USB. The user decides where the measurements will be performed and connects the Sampler and Doser unit to these locations with tubing. The locations can then be “dosed” with tracer gas, and air samples can be taken to be analyzed by the Gas Monitor (see Figure 1).

The user starts the 7651 software and selects the type of measurement task to be performed. This can be either a ventilation measurement task, using both the doser and the sampler functions on the 1403 unit, or a multi-point gas monitoring task, using only the sampler system of the 1403 unit.

# Application Areas:

- Ventilation and air exchange measurements using tracer gases in up to 3 locations
- Flow in ducts
- Multi-gas monitoring in up to 6 locations
- Tracking of pollutant spread
- Multi Gas Monitoring e.g. Freon 134a and CO2 as complimentary marker in indoor air quality applications

# Measurement Modes

Ventilation Measurement Tasks

The 7651 enables comprehensive ventilation measurements. The use of a Multipoint Sampler and Doser unit allows up to 3 dosing and 6 sampling points.

The user sets up the sampler and doser unit by selecting the dosing/sampling channels and the type of dosing to be used in the task. Dosing can be done either by providing a constant flow of tracer gas to one location or by maintaining a constant concentration of tracer gas at up to three locations. Up to six different dosing setups can be made and stored by the 7651 and the user can switch between different setups during a measurement task. The software controls the Gas Monitor and which gases to be measured at each location (Figure 2).

Figure 2a: The Gas Monitor Setup dialog. This dialog enables the user to select the number of gases the monitor will measure, the sampling interval, and define whether the monitor should perform water and cross-compensation.

When setup is complete, the measurement task can be started. The 7651 runs the measurement procedure automatically and measurement results are displayed on the computer’s screen and can be stored for further analysis.

Fig 2b: The Multipoint Sampler and Doser setup, allows you to define which doser channel is linked to a given named Location.

# Doser settings

Up to 6 different doser setup’s can be predefined and used during the analysis see figure 3.

In the Dosing setup it is possible to predefine up to 6 different dosing setup’s the user can then change between these dosing setup’s while a measurement is running.

The Algorithm is used to define if constant dose or constant concentration method is to be used during the measurement.
