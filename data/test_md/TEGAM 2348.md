High Current Output

The 2348’s current capabilities make it ideal as a buffer for signal generation devices used in solenoid or magnetic excitation. This unique amplifier meets requirements for MEMS testing, transducer characterization, and pulse applications. Its high voltage stability and low noise characteristics also meet the demands of mass spectrometry and related scientific applications.

A continuous current of 750 mA is available at voltages up to 50 Vp-p. This provides 18.75 W of AC or DC output power to 500 kHz. The instrument’s bandwidth ranges from DC to 2.0 MHz.

All of this performance is packed into a compact, rack-mountable chassis no larger than a typical function generator.
