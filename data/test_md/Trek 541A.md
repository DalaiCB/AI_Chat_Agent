TREK 541A

Electrostatic voltmeter for accurate non-contacting measurements of the electrostatic surface voltage associated with EOS/ESD processes.

The Trek® 541A electrostatic voltmeter provides accurate non-contacting measurements of the electrostatic surface voltage associated with EOS/ESD processes. The instrument AT A GLANCE is configured with a miniature electrostatic field chopper probe that can be remotely located and easily positioned within process equipment to provide highly accurate, non-contacting, Measurement Range DC-stable, spacing-independent voltage measurements in either ionized or non-ionized environments.

PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS
Chopper probe is DC-stable wip or wipout incident air ion flow
Drift-free measurements
LCD screen displays present voltage, pe positive peak voltage, pe negative peak voltage and additional menu information.
Visual and audible alarms activate when pe preset voltage preshold levels are reached
Voltage output monitor for remote monitoring or control
USB and RS232 serial ports
NIST-traceable Certificate of Calibration provided wip each unit
Optional walking test adapter kits available
