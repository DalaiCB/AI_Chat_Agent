# ARTESYN PTH05060 5 Vin Single Output

Advanced Energy's Artesyn PTH05060 series non-isolated DC-DC converter complies with the Point-of-Load Alliance (POLA) standard. It offers some of the most advanced POL functions in the industry, including Auto-Track™ sequencing for controlled power-up/power-down of complex semiconductor devices such as DSPs, FPGAs and ASICs. Standard features include pre-bias startup, input undervoltage lockout, remote sense, remote On/Off and auto resetting short-circuit protection.

PTH05060 series converters have an input voltage range of 4.5 to 5.5 Vdc and an output voltage that can be trimmed from 0.8 to 3.6 Vdc to meet a wide variety of semiconductor power needs. Rated at 36 watts, the converters offer up to 94% efficiency and can deliver up to 10 amps. Available in through-hole horizontal mount and surface-mount versions, they have a small 0.62 x 0.99 inch (15.7 x 25.3 mm) footprint and an installed height of just 0.35 inch (9 mm).

# PTH05060

OUTPUT VOLTAGE ADJUSTMENT

The ultra-wide output voltage trim range offers major advantages to users who select the PTH05060. It is no longer necessary to purchase a variety of modules in order to cover different output voltages. The output voltage can be trimmed in a range of 0.8 Vdc to 3.6 Vdc. When the PTH05060 converter leaves the factory the output has been adjusted to the default voltage of 0.8 V.

**Efficiency Table (Io = 10 A)**
|Output Voltage|Efficiency|
|---|---|
|Vo = 1.0 V|85%|
|Vo = 1.2 V|86%|
|Vo = 1.5 V|89%|
|Vo = 1.8 V|90%|
|Vo = 2.0 V|91%|
|Vo = 2.5 V|92%|
|Vo = 3.3 V|94%|

Notes:

1. Remote ON/OFF. Positive Logic
- ON: Pin 3 open; or V > Vin - 0.5 V
- OFF: Pin 3 GND; or V < 0.8 V (min - 0.2 V).
2. See Figures 1 & 2 for safe operating curves.
3. A 330 μF electrolytic input capacitor is required for proper operation. The capacitor must be rated for a minimum of 500 mA rms of ripple current.
4. An external output capacitor is not required for basic operation. Adding 330 μF of distributed capacitance at the load will improve the transient response.
5. 1 A/μs load step, 50 to 100% Iomax, Cout = 330 μF.
6. If utilized Vout will track applied voltage by ±0.3 V (up to Vo set point).
7. The pre-bias start-up feature is not compatible with Auto-Track™. This is because when the module is under Auto-Track™ control, it is fully active and will sink current if the output voltage is below that of a back-feeding source. Therefore to ensure a pre-bias hold-off, one of the following two techniques must be followed when input power is first applied to the module. The Auto-Track™ function must either be disabled, or the module’s output held off using the Inhibit pin. Refer to Application Note 159 for more details.
8. Tape and reel packaging only available on the surface-mount versions.
9. NOTICE: Some models do not support all options. Please contact your local Artesyn representative or use the on-line model number search tool at http://www.artesyn.com to find a suitable alternative.
