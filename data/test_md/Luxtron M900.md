# LUXTRON M924 OEM MODULE

Fiber optic temperature sensing for medical research, general research and development, and original equipment manufacturing (OEM) applications with a temperature range of -100 to 330ºC

The Luxtron® m924 module uses Fluoroptic® technology, based on a temperature sensitive phosphorescent sensor attached to the end of an optical fiber. The complete m924 OEM solution consists of the electronics module assembly plus Luxtron probes and accessories. The system provides precise and repeatable in-situ temperature measurements for control of processes involving RF, EMI, magnetic fields and high voltages.

# Luxtron m924 OEM Module

# OVERVIEW

The m924 Module is designed to replace the Luxtron m600 OEM Series module and FOT Lab Kit with better performance and a modern architecture.

Safe, Non-Metallic Temperature Sensing

The standard OEM Module is a single printed circuit board (PCB) with an optional DIN-rail mountable enclosure. The standard m924 Module has RS232 (ASCII) and RS485 (Modbus) digital communications, and optional analog output for easy OEM system integration.

Compatible with Luxtron Probes and Custom Probes

Non-metallic and electrically non-conductive, the Fluoroptic® temperature probes are immune to EMI and voltages that adversely affect conventional sensors, such as thermocouples, RTDs and thermistors. By using material of minimal thermal conductance, these probes measure temperature on minute samples without perturbing or heat sinking the sample. We offer diverse medical, industrial, and process experience to develop custom probes to meet specific Lab and OEM requirements.

Field Proven Fluoroptic Technology

Luxtron pioneered the field of fiber optics in 1978 with our trusted Fluoroptic technology. Thousands of our OEM modules have been installed in various, challenging applications with reliable, repeatable performance.
