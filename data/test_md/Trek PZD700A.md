# TREK PZD700A

High voltage piezo driver/power amplifier for precise control of output voltages in customer specified bipolar or unipolar ranges within available range settings.

The Trek® PZD700A is a high-voltage DC-stable piezo driver/amplifier designed to achieve the accurate output responses and high slew rates demanded by reactive loads by utilizing a four-quadrant active output stage that sinks or sources current into reactive or resistive loads. The Trek PZD700A is configured as a non-inverting amplifier. An inverting configuration is available. Both configurations are available as either single or dual channel instruments. They are bench top operable or 19-in rack mountable.

# PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS

- Four-quadrant output for driving capacitive loads
- Closed loop system for high accuracy
- Short-circuit protected for equipment protection
- All solid-state design for maintenance free operation
- DC-stable for programmable supply applications
- Low output noise for ultra-accurate outputs
- Model PZD700A M/S is also available with twice the current capability of the Trek PZD700A
- NIST-traceable Certificate of Calibration provided with each unit
