# THERMAL INSPECTION 724

The ThermalSpection 724 system allows for continuous monitoring of the temperature profile of assets within an electrical power substation remotely. It helps detect temperature deviations from normal operation conditions to ensure safe and reliable operations.

An overview schematic of the system is shown below. The system consists of thermal and visible cameras mounted on a positioner with continuous 360° pan range and tilt range of ±45°. A junction box with all of the necessary hardware for power and data transfer is also included. This allows for quick access to the camera’s thermal readings and configuration options. Fixed image cameras and pyrometers can also be added to the system.

# SYSTEM COMPONENTS

The ThermalSpection system solution includes a substation hardened enclosure with thermal and visual imagers mounted on a pan-tilt positioner. The system can be expanded with optional fixed thermal imagers and fixed single point infrared pyrometers. Combine these items into a unique asset condition monitoring system to remotely control, monitor, trend, archive, and alarm on thermal deviations.

TS724DV-PT: Pan-Tilt Thermal ImagerThe TS724DV-PT includes thermal camera, visual camera, and a pan-tilt positioner that is controlled remotely using LumaSpec RT software. The enclosure protects the cameras from weather and temperature changes and uses a solid state cooling system for reliable, long-term installation. The rugged pan-tilt positioner allows for a 360° continuous rotation on a ±45° tilt axis. Ease of installation is designed into the system with each camera including a stainless steel junction box and a substation hardened 4.5 m (15’) umbilical cable to easily connect camera to box. The user only needs to bring power and communications link to the IP66 (NEMA 4X) junction box.

# OPTIONAL COMPONENTS

TS724: Fixed Mount Thermal ImagerThe stationary mount TS724 includes a thermal camera in a weatherized enclosure with adjustable base for mounting. The 640 x 480 resolution thermal camera allows for precise targeting of small objects in a wider field of view. Multiple wide viewing angles (12°, 25°, 42°, and 70°) allow for complete customization for different site layouts and applications.

IN 210: Pyrometer Point Temperature SensorThe IN 210 is a stationary pyrometer for non-contact temperature measurement of coated metal and non-metallic surfaces between -32°C and 900°C. These pyrometers may be mounted to measure temperatures on objects hidden from view of the TS724DV-PT imagers or fixed mount TS724 imagers.

# Field Imaging Process Controller (FIPC)

The FIPC includes network devices for connecting to the ThermalSpection camera via standard Ethernet connections and computer system for communicating, configuring and processing the camera data. The FIPC also remotely controls the PTU and the automated software features (e.g. Substation Auto Tour). The FIPC should be located in the substation’s control room or field cabinet designed to support computer equipment.

# Central Communication Hub (CCH)

The Central Communication Hub (CCH) is a weatherized enclosure and is constructed of stainless steel. It is used to provide a central connection point for the cameras and sensors and mounted in the field to link fiber optics to the controller located in the control house. The CCH offers support for both copper or hardened fiber optic cables for network connections between sensors and the controller.

# THERMAL INSPECTION CVM

Real-time thermal imaging solution for fault detection and monitoring for critical vessels such as gasifier skin temperature.

Critical vessels in the chemicals, refining, and power industries operate at high temperature and pressure and are at risk of failure as joints and refractory degrade. The consequences of undetected failures can be very serious. Conventional methods of real-time monitoring are unreliable and expensive to install and operate. Advanced Energy's ThermalSpection™ CVM infrared imaging system offers real-time, continuous fault and hot-spot monitoring, allowing plant operators to identify problems before they become emergencies. The system offers a turn-key solution for monitoring critical vessels, such as gasifier skin temperature.

# ThermalSpection CVM

# OVERVIEW

System Options

The ThermalSpection system has several optional components, allowing you to customize a solution for your specific needs:

- Analog outputs
- Auxiliary pyrometer sensors integrated into the system to measure critical areas or tight locations that are obstructed from view (blind spots) to the thermal imaging camera
- Remote controlled pan and tilt mechanism for automated and remote aiming of the camera

Easy Integration Into the Plant's DCS

The ThermalSpection system is fully digital and uses standard Ethernet LAN. This allows easy and cost-effective transfer of digital image data to control rooms. Additionally, the LumaSpecTM software has modules that support output via Modbus or OPC to the plant’s DCS.

Designed for Hazardous Environments

Each thermal imaging camera is mounted in a sealed housing that includes internal cooling and a positive pressure purge to prevent dirt or flammable gases from entering the enclosure. Each camera has an Internet IP address and password protection, allowing control from any computer in the network. All field hardware is protected by ATEX or Class I, Div 2 certified housings.

The ThermalSpection in its protective enclosure. Power, communication, and air connections are contained in a single hose.

# SOFTWARE WITH AUTOMATED ANALYSIS

Advanced Energy's LumaSpec software provides advanced features in a user-friendly interface. From a single computer, the software can send commands to and gather data from up to 24 cameras mounted in the field. Thermal data can be captured in snapshot frames at set intervals, or capture can be triggered by temperature alarms connected to user-defined Regions of Interest (ROIs).

- Auto "Hot Spot" Tracking Feature
- HTML displays for broadcast on plant intranet
- Rate of change temperature charts
- Data Historian Archive
- Integrates with Plant’s DCS
