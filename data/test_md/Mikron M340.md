# MIKRON M340

Portable, sub-zero temperature blackbody calibration source. Compact, high resolution, and high temperature stability for low temperatures of -20 to 150°C (-4 to 302°F).

The Mikron® M340 is a portable blackbody calibration source covering the range from sub-zero to 150°C with 0.1° resolution. The thermoelectric heating/cooling mechanism is utilized to achieve a compact and easy-to-use blackbody source. The M340 has unusually high temperature stability and a stabilization time of only 10 minutes. Source temperature is closely controlled by a self-tuning PID controller which displays temperature on a digital readout.

OVERVIEW

Blackbody calibration sources are infrared radiators used for calibrating and verifying the output signals of infrared thermometers (pyrometers), thermal imaging systems, heat flux measurement systems, or spectrographic analysis systems. Advanced Energy supplies a unique selection of very precise calibration sources that are traceable to national standards. Quotations for custom designs and variations are available upon request.

are superior because of the emissivity values, homogeneous emission areas, and a wide range of different sized apertures to adapt to the desired target area. In addition, fast heat-up times and high temperature stability are guaranteed. The quality of our calibration sources is guaranteed by tests, burn-in times, and radiometric calibrations. On most models, a certificate is provided to document the traceability to the international temperature scale ITS90 and NIST.

Mikron calibration sources have long been the gold standard to calibrate the instruments that keep your operations up and running. These blackbodies
