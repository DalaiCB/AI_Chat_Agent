# ARTESYN AVO200 SERIES

200 Watt 1/8th Brick DC/DC Converter

Advanced Energy's Artesyn AVO200 series of eighth-brick isolated DC-DC converters comprises two single output models offering fully regulated voltages of 5.0 V or 12 V. These converters are rated at 200 watts continuous power; the 5.0 V model can deliver up to 40 amps, while the 12 V model can deliver up to 16.7 amps. They have a wide 2:1 input range of 36 to 75 Vdc and are primarily designed for use with standard 48 V telecommunications equipment supplies. Typical applications include wireless, optical or access networks, as well as server and computing infrastructures.
