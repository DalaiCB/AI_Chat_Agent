TREK 677B

High voltage power amplifier/supply designed to provide precise control of output voltages using an all-solid-state design for wide bandwidth, high slew rate, and low-noise.

The Trek® 677B is a high voltage power amplifier/supply that can operate one of two modes: as a high voltage amplifier when it is configured as a non-inverting amplifier with a fixed gain or as high voltage power supply that responds to front panel controls to command exact output voltage or current. The four-quadrant, active output stage sinks or sources current into reactive or resistive loads throughout the output voltage range. This type of output is essential to achieve an accurate output response and high slew rate demanded by a variety of loads such as highly capacitive or reactive loads.
