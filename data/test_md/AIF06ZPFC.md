# ARTESYN AIF06ZPFC SERIES

2400 Watt Full Brick PFC Converter

The AIF06ZPFC series full-brick power factor correction module accepts a wide 85–264 Vac input and presents a unity power factor. Rated at 2400 watts, the module has a high conversion efficiency of 97.3% and provides a nominal non-isolated output voltage of 400 Vdc. Featuring an industry-standard 2.4 x 4.6 full-brick form factor and a height of only 0.55 inch, they have a power density of 395 watts per cubic inch.
