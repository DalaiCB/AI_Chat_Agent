# Solvix® DC and Pulsed-DC Power Supplies

Reduced Substrate Damage and Process Contamination

The Solvix series reduces arc-caused contamination and damage with a fast reaction time (< 1 μs) and selectable detection modes. Pulsed-DC units reduce arc formation and minimize arc energy by periodically reversing electrode voltage to clear charge buildup. The result is high-quality films, even from highly arc-prone processes.

High Throughput

Pulsed-DC units can be combined and synchronized for higher-power operation.

Efficient Installation and Service

Modular in design, Solvix units are easy to install and make preventive maintenance easy to perform in the field, reducing maintenance costs.

Adaptability to a Range of Process Requirements

With a flexible architecture, the Solvix series offers a wide range of power levels from 3 to 30 kW. In addition, multiple communication options are available to meet the needs of your unique manufacturing process.
