# Module J106 Signal Connector

|Pin #|Signal Name|Description|
|---|---|---|
|1|ISO_M_INHIBIT|Isolated signal to inhibit the module output|
|2|ISO_M_INHIBIT_RTN|Ground reference for ISO_M_INHIBIT signal|
|3|ISO_POWER_GOOD|Isolated signal that indicates module output voltage or current is within regulation|
|4|ISO_POWER_GOOD_RTN|Ground reference for ISO_POWER_GOOD signal|
|5|0-10_VI_PROG|Used to control the output voltage by applying between 0 to 10 V to this pin. This pin will function when the module is configured to Analog Voltage Source (AVS) mode|
|6|0-5_VI_PROG|Used to control the output voltage by applying between 0 to 5 V to this pin. This pin will function when the module is configured to Analog Voltage Source (AVS) mode|
|7|VI_TRIM_EN#|Connecting this pin to D_RTN will enable the trimmer potentiometer. This pin will function when the module is configured to Digital Voltage Source (DVS) or Digital Current Source (DCS) modes|
|8|D_RTN|Ground reference for 0-10_VI_PROG & 0-5_VI_PROG signals|
|9|ISHARE|0.4 to 8.4 V voltage signal for active current sharing|
|10|ISHARE_RTN|Ground reference for ISHARE signal|
|11|RS+|Signal used for module output voltage positive remote sense|
|12|RS-|Signal used for module output voltage negative remote sense|

Note: The mating connector is Landwin 2050S1200 with pin 2053T021V.
