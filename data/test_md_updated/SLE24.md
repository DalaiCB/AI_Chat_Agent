Note:

1. Other output voltages in the range of 6.0 V through 52 V are available, contact our sales representative for details.

2. Measured at output connector with 20 MHz bandwidth and 0.1 μF ceramic in parallel with 10 μF electrolytic capacitors.

3. "B" in the model number (SLE24S0903B01) indicates interchangeable blade model. "C" = N.A.fixed blade input (12V model only)

4. "03" in the model number indicates 2.5 x 5.5 x 9.5 mm straight barrel type connector. Other output connector options are available, please contact our sales representative for details.

5. Power supply is not fitted with the AC blade, this is to be ordered separately. See outline drawing below for details

6. Power supplies are not medical equipment (applied parts), medical product manufacturers take responsibility for further evaluation of class B/BF/CF compliance of their end product.
