# MECHANICAL DRAWINGS

Heatsink (Option –HS)

The advantages of adding a heatsink are:

1. To help heat dissipation and increase the stability and reliability of DC/DC converters at high operating temperature atmosphere.
2. To upgrade the operating temperature of DC/DC converters, please refer to Derating Curve.
