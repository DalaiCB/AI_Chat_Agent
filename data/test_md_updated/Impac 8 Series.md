# IMPAC SERIES 8 PRO

# OVERVIEW

The Series 8 Pro pyrometers are specially designed with aluminium die-cast housing for daily use under rough industrial conditions. The easy focusable precision optics provides small spot sizes for measuring distances between 500 and 9000 mm.

The bright, optimized view finder with exact spot indication and built-in temperature display facilitates accurate aiming on the object. Moreover, the large measurement data storage offers the best possibility for subsequent interpretation of the measured values.

The extremely short response time of 1 ms allows exact measurements of fast moving objects and very quick detection of temperature differences. The maximum temperature can be stored in the built-in peak picker (maximum value storage).

For high temperatures, the IS 8 Pro is available in two temperature ranges between 600 and 2500°C, for the medium temperatures the IGA 8 Pro is available with ranges from 250 to 1600°C and 280 to 2000°C.

The IS 8-GS Pro is a special version for use in foundries and has a temperature range of 1000 to 2000°C.

These portable pyrometers are mainly used in the steel, glass, and forging industries.

OPTICS

The pyrometers are equipped with high-quality focusable optics. Adjusting the optics to the required measuring distance achieves the spot sizes specified in the table. The adjustment can be made via the scale on the objective or by focusing the measuring object in the viewfinder. Interim values for distances or spot sizes can be calculated by interpolation.

With standard focusable optics:

Measuring distances between 500 and 9000 mm with small spot sizes can be achieved with the pyrometers.

With additional close-up lens:

Measuring distances between 250 and 500 mm can be achieved with the optional close-up lens, extending the range up to 9000 mm.

# PORTAWIN OVERVIEW

PortaWin is the analyzing software for Series 8 portable IMPAC pyrometers. The pyrometer can be connected via USB interface with the PC. Then the measured values can be read out, stored permanently, and retrieved at any time. Additionally, the software offers helpful functions such as graphics, monitoring, recording, and analyzing of measured values.

# IS 8-GS PRO: SPECIAL PYROMETER FOR FOUNDRIES

The IS 8-GS Pro is specially designed for non-contact temperature measurement of molten metals in the range between 1000 to 2000°C. In casting processes, the correct measurement can only be done on the pouring stream to avoid the influence of slag. The specially selected wavelength of 0.55 μm facilitates this accurate temperature measurement as molten metals have their maximum emissivity in this spectral range. Additionally, the influence of changing emissivity is reduced in this range and any interference of the measurement by atmospherical absorption is avoided. A longer response time of 0.5 s prevents the possible influence of hot sparks. Even for long measuring distances, the easy focusable precision optics achieve small spot sizes (e.g. at a distance of 5 m the spot is only 16 mm) to allow larger safety distances between the operator and the pouring stream. The IS 8-GS Pro is also equipped with a switchable filter in the viewfinder to protect the eyes against the extremely bright radiation of the pouring stream.
