# HITEK POWER EG353 SERIES

# HIGH-STABILITY 35 kV HIGH VOLTAGE POWER SUPPLIES

Dependable, high-stability power supplies for scanning electron microscopes (SEM) with built-in flexibility to accommodate various Schottky emission electron gun configurations. The HiTek Power® EG353 series comes standard with Advanced Energy’s Direct Drive Digital Control (D3C), enabling a wide range of operational and diagnostic capabilities through an intuitive GUI. D3C improves MTBF and reliability while using a smaller footprint.

# PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS

- Lowest ripple and high-stability power supplies for resolutions to -1 nm
- Small footprint module or 19 in rack-mounted option provides the greatest installation flexibility
- Market-leading reliability and performance enabled by AE's Direct Drive Digital Control (D3C) technology
- Better efficiency, more consistent operation, low variance to component change, greater reliability, and easier testing
- Low ripple (< 1.6 ppm, accelerator), and high stability (< 10 ppm, accelerator)
- Additional grounded outputs may be added for greater flexibility
- Easy-to-use digital control and monitoring minimizes setup and configuration times (fiber-isolated RS-232)
- Customer-defined derivatives and connection options available upon request
