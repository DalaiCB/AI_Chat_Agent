# PARAMOUNT® PLUS PULSED-RF POWER SUPPLIES

Powerful Pulse Control for Emerging Applications

Sophisticated multi-level pulsing and pulse waveform control enable the pulse-shape repeatability into dynamic loads required for tomorrow’s device geometries.

Multi-Level Pulsing

Two Power Set Point Levels Over Full Power Output Range

- Plasma operation maintained during pulse low state, reducing impedance swing when pulse goes to high (source)
- Ability to set two separate ion-energy peaks (bias)

|Continuous Wave (CW)|Single-Level Pulsing|Dual-Level Pulsing|
|---|---|---|
|Low Duty Cycle| |High Duty Cycle|
