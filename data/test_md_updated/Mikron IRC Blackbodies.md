# MIKRON IRC 35 TO IRC 150

Calibration source with a single fixed temperature for inspection of pyrometers. Temperatures ranging from 35 to 150°C (95 to 302°F).

The Mikron® calibration sources of type IRC 35 to IRC 150 are instruments for inspection of the measurement accuracy of pyrometers (radiation thermometers) at a fixed temperature value. The highly accurate control ensures a constant and stable heating of the large emitter surface with a high temperature uniformity with a maximum deviation of 0.2°C. The robust stainless steel design guarantees the operation even under rough industrial environments. The compact dimensions also allow for verifying fixed installed pyrometers at the measuring location.

# PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS

- Ten different types for fixed adjusted temperatures of 35°C, 45°C, 70°C, 75°C, 95°C, 100°C, 110°C, 120°C, 140°C, or 150°C
- High emissivity: 98%
- Large aperture diameter: 50.8 mm (2")
- Short warm-up time
- High temperature stability
- Small dimensions
- Stainless steel housing
