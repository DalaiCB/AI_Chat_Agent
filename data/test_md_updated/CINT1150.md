# POWER FAIL/DC OK SIGNALS - J300

AC Power Fail/DC OKPF/DC OK: During normal operation stays HIGHGoes HIGH 100 to 500 ms after main outputGoes LOW with 5 ms warning before loss of output from AC failureVc1 12v10.OK J3oo_PinPower supply J3oo Pin 2

AC Power failure and DC OK signals use the same pin, so the signals can be used as follows:

- DC OK: Pin2 = HIGH & Pin1 = HIGH
- AC Power Fail: Pin2 = LOW & Pin1 = LOW

# CHARACTERISTIC CURVES

Output VS. Temperature100 W convection cooled and 150 W continuous with 200 LFM airflow, derating output power to 50% at 70ºC.

# Output Power vs. Temperature

| |Convection|200 LFM Cooling|
|---|---|---|
| |Output Power vs. Temperature| |

# Efficiency VS. Loading

The high efficiency is achieved by using LLC technology, PFC topology minimizing switching losses. Synchronous SCHOTTKY or ultra-fast diode is used as rectifier in CINT1150 family because of high output voltage level.
