# TREK ESD ON-BOARD CONTROLLERS (OBC)

Custom on-board controllers for electrostatic monitors.

Trek® manufactures and supplies electrostatic measurement instruments for ESD applications, including custom on-board controllers. Accurate measurements are important for identifying sources of charge generation, and for verifying the effectiveness of ESD countermeasures that are employed in ESD control programs.

The low-profile PC board design makes them ideal for continuous monitoring of electrostatic voltage in automated processes. A precision voltage divider output provides a low-voltage replica of the measured electrostatic voltage for interface to a facilities monitoring system.

Trek electrostatic monitors accomplish voltage measurements without physical contact to the measure surface by making use of a chopper stabilized, field-nulling technique which maintains DC stability and high accuracy over wide probe-to-surface variations. This technique assures no loading of the voltage and permits accurate measurements without the need to establish a fixed probe spacing.
