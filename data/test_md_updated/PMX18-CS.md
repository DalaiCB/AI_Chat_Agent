# Model PMX18-CS RF POWER CALIBRATION AND MEASUREMENT ASSEMBLED IN U.S.A.

Automated Power Sensor Calibration System From ADVANCED ENERGY / TEGAM, the leaders in power sensor calibration.

TRUST is an essential feature in any measurement tool and TEGAM’s new PMX18-CS turnkey power sensor calibration system is a tool you can rely on every day with confidence.

Built around the proven TEGAM 2505A RF Power Standard and 1830A RF Power Meter, the PMX18-CS leverages TEGAM’s 30+ years of RF power measurement expertise into a turnkey system designed to increase your RF power sensor calibration capability and throughput. The PMX18-CS simplifies the tedious process of power sensor calibration, providing cost-effective calibrations in a fraction of the time required for manual calibrations.

Packaged in a compact benchtop rack cabinet, the PMX18-CS includes the hardware, accessories, and tools necessary to perform automated calibrations for a broad range of power sensors from Keysight, Rohde & Schwarz, Ladybug, Anritsu, and more. PS-Cal® power sensor calibration automation software is included, making the PMX18-CS ideal for both experienced and new calibration technicians alike.

Ready to Work: The PMX18-CS comes packaged with everything necessary to calibrate reflection and cal factors for 9 kHz to 18 GHz power sensors. The system includes an RF standard, RF power meter, RF signal source, VNA, plus an assortment of accessories to increase your calibration capability.

Accurate: The TEGAM 2505A RF Power Standard provides uncertainties typically found only in primary standards laboratories.

Automated: PS-Cal provides calibration automation and EEPROM read/write capability for a variety of power sensors from major manufacturers such as Keysight, Rohde & Schwarz, Ladybug, Anritsu, and more. See our PMX Series datasheet for details.

Convenient: The system is configured in a compact rack cabinet for use on a benchtop or cart, or wherever you need it.

Mobile: Add the optional ruggedized cabinet and the PMX18-CS becomes mobile – perfect for military mobile calibration labs and commercial on-site applications.

All instrumentation and accessories arrive configured and ready to use. PS-Cal and the required drivers are pre-installed on the included system controller, and each PMX18-CS is fully tested before leaving our factory. Onsite installation and training are also available. Inquire at time of purchase for more information.

TEGAM’s 30 years of microwave power measurement experience and field-proven instruments provide measurements you can trust.

When the Measurement Matters, Be Certain with TEGAM.
