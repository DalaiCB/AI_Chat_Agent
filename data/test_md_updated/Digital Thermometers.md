These new models are the most accurate thermometers ever offered by TEGAM to meet the increasing demands of regulatory requirements in food, pharmaceutical, and materials applications where process temperature measurement is critical. Superior instrument accuracy, combined with the “Probe Offset” feature to zero out probe errors, makes their “system” accuracy unmatched in the industry.
