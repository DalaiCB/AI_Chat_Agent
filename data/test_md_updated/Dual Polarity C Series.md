1 For positive polarity unit, Vprog varies from 0 to 4.64 VDC. For negative polarity unit, Vprog varies inversely from 5 to 0.36 VDC.

2 SIm factor is ±2% @ 100% LOAD, 100% HVout. Valid from 10 to 100% Iout.

3 SVm factor is ±2% assuming a 10 MΩ measurement impedance. Valid from 10 to 100% HVout.

4 See interface schematic for definition.

5 Applies to interfaces on both positive and negative polarity units. For details on -I5/-I10 interfacing, see technical note TN-I5-I10-1.

6 For the -I5 interface, Imon, Iprog, Vmon, and Vprog input/output signals vary from 0 to 5 VDC (full-scale).

7 For the -I10 interface, Imon, Iprog, Vmon, and Vprog input/output signals vary from 0 to 10 VDC (full-scale).

8 SVm factor is ±1% for both -I5 and -I10 Interfaces. SVp factor is also ±1% and is only valid for 10 to 100% HVout.

9 SIm factor is ±1% for both -I5 and -I10 Interfaces. SIp factor is also ±1% and is only valid for 10 to 100% Iout.
