# SEKIDENKO OR400T

Advanced Energy’s OR400T optical fiber thermometer (OFT) delivers accurate, non-contact temperature measurements in a compact form factor. AE’s OR400T OFT is ideally suited for several high-volume semiconductor applications, including:

- Epi
- PECVD
- LPCVD
- PVD
- MOCVD

Like all of AE’s OFTs, the OR400T model provides extended-range, low-temperature measurements through improved optical signal gathering.

Improves Temperature Measurement Accuracy

Enhances Wafer-to-Wafer Uniformity

Provides a Cost-Competitive Alternative to Thermocouples

Traditional thermocouple measurement is unsuitable for many applications where making physical contact with the substrate will cause damage and inaccuracy due to heat transfer effects. The OR400T OFT measures direct wafer temperature in situ—without contacting the wafer—for enhanced wafer-to-wafer uniformity and improved accuracy in temperature readings.

The OR400T OFT provides a cost-competitive alternative to thermocouple-based measurements with the added benefit of non-contact, in-situ temperature measurement and immunity from RF noise. Because of its compact design, the OR400T OFT can be easily integrated to meet the unique requirements of your process application.

Each OFT system consists of a controller, an optical sensor, and an optical fiber. The use of a fiber optic cable allows for remote positioning of the controller away from RF and other sources of EMI. The sensor detects emitted near-infrared (NIR) light from the target, typically a substrate. A fiber optic cable then transmits the NIR light from the sensor to the controller, where the light collected is converted to a temperature reading.

Each sensor is custom-designed to meet the functional and mechanical requirements of your unique application. The results: higher repeatability and increased yield.
