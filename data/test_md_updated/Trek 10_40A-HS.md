# TREK 10/40A-HS

High voltage power amplifier with an all-solid-state design for high slew rate, wide bandwidth, and low-noise operation for use in industrial and research applications. The Trek® 10/40A-HS is a DC-stable, high-speed, high voltage power amplifier used in industrial and research applications. It features an all-solid-state design for high slew rate, wide bandwidth and low-noise operation. The four quadrant, active output stage sinks or sources current into reactive or resistive loads throughout the output voltage range. This type of output is essential to achieve an accurate output response and high slew rate demanded by a variety of loads such as highly capacitive or reactive loads. It is configured as a non-inverting amplifier.

# TREK 10/40A-HS HIGH VOLTAGE POWER AMPLIFIER

# TECHNICAL DATA

|Environmental Specifications| |
|---|---|
|Temperature|0 to 40°C (32 to 104°F)|
|Relative Humidity|Up to 85%, noncondensing|
|Altitude|Up to 2000 meters (6561.68 ft)|

# Features

- High Voltage On/Off Dynamic Adjustment
- Limit/Trip Mode
- Current Trip Limit Status Indicator/Connector
- Out of Regulation Status

Local: Individual push-button switches

Remote: TTL compatible input. TTL high (or open) turns off high voltage output. TTL low turns on high voltage output.

Graduated one-turn panel potentiometer is used to optimize the AC response for various load parameters.

Switch selectable for either limit or trip. Graduated one-turn panel potentiometer is used to adjust limit or trip level from 0 to 100% peak current. There is one LED indicator and one BNC connector.

An indicator will illuminate and a BNC will provide a TTL low when the Trek 10/40A-HS fails to produce the required high-voltage output such as during current limit.

Illuminates and a TTL low is provided when unit fails to produce required HV output such as during a current limit.
