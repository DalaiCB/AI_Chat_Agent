# OVERVIEW

Complex Processes

Optimal operation of Sulfur Recovery Unit (SRU), Sulphur Burner, and Thermal Oxidizer furnaces require accurate process Gas (Flame) measurement and accurate Refractory measurement for operational safety (high temperature alarms).

Of particular importance is control of the furnace process temperatures to prevent damage to the furnace refractory and assurance that reaction or destruction temperatures are reached and maintained.

The Problem

Thermocouple measurement of acid processes either fail prematurely or are protected by multiple thermo wells and sweep air systems that make thermal transmission to the actual thermocouple inaccurate or slow and only provides a refractory measurement not useful for process control. Typical single channel infrared pyrometers do not compensate for changing flame transparencies and only provide one wavelength measurement. Clients must settle for either a Gas (Flame) or Refractory measurement or make multiple installations requiring multiple ports and hardware installations.

Changing flame transparency is a common issue that affects typical infrared pyrometer measurements. Combustion changes in the processes changes the Gas (Flame) transparency and affects the Gas and Refractory IR measurements. A clean burning flame becomes transparent to the IR Gas measurements. The transparency of the gases will cause the Gas IR Measurement to see the cooler refractory and include this into the gas measurement, which results in a lower than actual temperature measurement. The opposite happens for a dirty burning flame that will limit the refractory measurement from seeing through the dirty flame and adding this flame influence to the refractory measurement.

The Solution

A single system installation with two independent IR filtered detectors that provides both Gas (Flame) and Refractory measurements simultaneously. The innovative Smart FMATM Flame Measurement Algorithm allows for accurate real-time flame transparency compensation and correction. Applying the flame transparency calculation with FMA removes the flame transparency errors due to the Gas (Flame) temperature, providing the highest accuracy in process temperatures. Both Gas and Refractory measurements are critical to the furnace operations. The Gas (Flame) measurement is used by the operator to detect thermal events before IR energy is absorbed by the refractory, creating a refractory thermal event. This method of early warning by use of the Gas (Flame) temperatures, allows added time for operators to make process changes and reduce potential Refractory thermal events before they can become critical by triggering a high level alarm system based on the Refractory temperature measurements set point.

Since flame transparency varies with the process feeds to the furnaces, the transparency effect on the IR measurements is a variable factor used to correct measurements in these applications.

# INSTALLATION PRINCIPLES

Location on Furnace

Utilization of the different temperature measurement systems depends upon the feed gases and burner design of the reactor. If you burn simple acid gas with combustion air, the Pulsar 4 should be installed two-thirds of the way downstream from the burner to the waste heat boiler. If there is a checker wall or choke ring, installation at Locations 2 and 3 (shown in the diagram below) is recommended.

With oxygen-enrichment, refractory integrity is critically important. Burner design and location become paramount in determining the placement of the IR thermometer. The RT Refractory Temperature should be installed aimed at the area where the designers anticipate the highest refractory temperatures. For example, Location 1 is recommended for checker wall protection and Location 4 for tube sheet monitoring. Temperatures at the tube sheet are especially critical since the ferrules and ceramic tube-to-metal junctions may face potential excessive temperature excursions as a result of oxygen-enrichment operations.

Mounting to the Furnace

The ET Pulsar 4 should be mounted on the horizontal diameter (no greater than ±15°) perpendicular to the vessel sighting on refractory, or adjacent to the burner sighting on the checker wall or tube sheet.

The SOF-8 Swing-out Fixture mounts to a 3-inch 150 or 300 pound ball valve connected to the furnace via a customer-supplied downstream purge connection. Minimum purge rates for downstream and viewport is 17 m3/h (@ standard conditions) SCFM. Client-supplied sealed flex lines should be used for power input and signal output in accordance with local codes for hazardous environments.

# E2T Pulsar 4

The E2T Pulsar Advanced uses a unique method called Smart Flame Measurement Algorithm (Smart FMA™) to compensate for varying gas transparency and their effects on gas and refractory IR temperature measurements. In a normal situation, a dirty flame can increase the signal emitted from the refractory depending on the quality, quantity, and absorption of the flame.

In a similar manner, some transparency of the flame or hot gas can cause refractory radiance to decrease the flame temperature. The FMA algorithm virtually removes these unwanted ‘crosstalk’ artifacts and solves for more meaningful refractory and flame/hot gas temperatures in real time.

The chart illustrates the difference between Standard operating mode and Smart FMA™ operating mode (field switchable). Note that as the flame intensity undergoes step changes, refractory (RT) and standard flame/hot gas (GT) waveforms have dampened responses. This is expected on the refractory due to the thermal mass of the refractory, but not on the flame response. With Smart FMA™ activated, the hot gas channel (GT) displays a step change similar to the actual combustion air and gas flows into the SRU.

|Time|Standard Refractory Channel (RT)|SMART FMA Refractory Channel (RT)|
|---|---|---|
|1000| |1842|
|1050| |1942|
|1100| |2042|
|1150| |2142|
|1200| |2242|
|1250| |242|
|1300| |2442|

# E2T Pulsar 4

FIELD CONFIGURABLE TO MULTIPLE TEMPERATURE COMBINATIONS

# Pulsar 4

The Pulsar 4 has the capability to measure one selected temperature measurement. For example, the single channel can measure refractory wall temperature or measure hot combustion gas temperature. The dual channel measurements capability is not activated for the Pulsar 4. An optional product firmware upgrade can be purchased to activate the Pulsar 4 Advanced capabilities. The Pulsar 4 is intended as a direct single channel replacement for clients with Pulsar II equipment. Each Pulsar 4 provides two identical analog outputs, but No FMA capability.

Field Selectable measurements:

- RT — Refractory Temperature
- GT — Gas Temperature
- FF — Average Integrated Temperature

# Pulsar 4 Advanced

The Pulsar 4 Advanced has been uniquely designed to have the ability to continuously measure two simultaneous temperatures. For example, one channel can measure refractory wall temperature while the second channel can measure hot combustion gas temperature. The dual channel measurements share the same optical path (viewport, isolation valve, etc.).

Each Pulsar 4 Advanced provides two analog outputs, FMA capability and when turned on, effect all outputs.

Field Selectable measurements:

- RT — Refractory Temperature
- GT — Gas Temperature
- FF — Average Integrated Temperature
- FMA — Flame Measurement Algorithm
