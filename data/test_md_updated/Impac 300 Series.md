# IMPAC IN 300

Digital pyrometer designed for temperature measurement of non-metallic surfaces between -20 to 600°C (-4 to 1112°F).

The Impac® IN 300 is a stationary pyrometer for non-contact temperature measurement of non-metallic surfaces or painted, coated, or anodized metals. The very small housing dimensions enable the integration of the pyrometer into compact production machines, the two-wire technique enables very easy electrical connection. The solid and robust design of the instrument guarantees high operational safety even in rough industrial environments.

# PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS

- Very small housing dimensions for easy installation, suitable for use in confined spaces
- Two-wire technique for current supply and temperature measurement at the same time
- Stainless steel housing
- Easy electrical and mechanical installation
- Suitable for food industry
- Ambient temperature up to 70°C without cooling
