# ARTESYN PTH12020

12 Vin Single Output

Advanced Energy's Artesyn PTH12020 series of non-isolated DC-DC converters complies with the Point-of-Load Alliance (POLA) standard. The converters offer some of the most advanced POL functions in the industry, including Auto-Track™ sequencing for controlled power-up/power-down of complex semiconductor devices such as DSPs, FPGAs and ASICs, and voltage margining. Standard features include pre-bias startup, input undervoltage lockout, remote sense, remote On/Off and auto resetting short-circuit protection.

|Total Power:|99 Watts|
|---|---|
|# of Outputs:|Single|

There are two models in the PTH12020 series of converters, both of which have an input voltage range of 10.8 to 13.2 Vdc. One model offers an output voltage that can be trimmed from 0.8 to 1.8 Vdc, the other has an output that can be trimmed from 1.2 to 5.5 Vdc, enabling a broad diversity of semiconductor power needs to be satisfied. The 0.8 to 1.8 V output converter offers up to 89% efficiency while the higher output voltage model can achieve up to 95%. Both converters are rated at 99 watts output power and can deliver up to 18 amps. Available in through-hole horizontal mount and surface-mount versions, they have a small 0.87 x 1.5 inch (22.1 x 38 mm) footprint and an installed height of just 0.35 inch (9 mm).

# PTH12020

OUTPUT VOLTAGE ADJUSTMENT

The ultra-wide output voltage trim range offers major advantages to users who select the PTH12020. It is no longer necessary to purchase a variety of modules in order to cover different output voltages. The output voltage can be trimmed in a range of 1.2 - 5.5 Vdc. When the PTH12020 converter leaves the factory the output has been adjusted to the default voltage of 1.2 V.

**Efficiency Table: PTH12020W (Io = 18 A)**
|Output Voltage|Efficiency|
|---|---|
|Vo = 5.0 V|95%|
|Vo = 3.3 V|93%|
|Vo = 2.5 V|92%|
|Vo = 1.8 V|90%|
|Vo = 1.5 V|88%|
|Vo = 1.2 V|86%|

**Efficiency Table: PTH12020L (Io = 18 A)**
|Output Voltage|Efficiency|
|---|---|
|Vo = 1.8 V|89%|
|Vo = 1.5 V|87%|
|Vo = 1.2 V|85%|
|Vo = 1.0 V|83%|
|Vo = 0.8 V|80%|

Notes:

1. Remote ON/OFF. Positive Logic
ON: Pin 3 open; or V > Vin - 0.5 V
OFF: Pin 3 GND; or V < 0.8 V (min - 0.2 V).
2. See Figures 1, 2 and 3 for safe operating curves.
3. A 560 μF electrolytic input capacitor is required for proper operation. The capacitor must be rated for a minimum of 800 mA rms of ripple current.
4. An external output capacitor is not required for basic operation. Adding 330 μF of distributed capacitance at the load will improve the transient response.
5. 1 A/μs load step, 50 to 100% Iomax, Cout = 330 μF.
6. If utilized Vout will track applied voltage by ±0.3 V (up to Vo set point).
7. Tape and reel packaging only available on the surface-mount versions.
8. NOTICE: Some models do not support all options. Please contact your local Artesyn representative or use the on-line model number search tool at http://www.artesyn.com to find a suitable alternative.
