- Measurement-at-a-Glance: Forward and reverse power, VSWR, and frequency simultaneously displayed on a large, easy-to-read OLED display.
- Convenient: Sensor and meter, in one convenient instrument. No separate meter, no elements needed, and no reconfiguration is necessary for forward and reverse power measurements.
- Flexibility: Take measurements directly from the meter or connect to a PC to collect measurement data using the available software.
- Accurate: 2-sigma accuracy of ±0.5% + 0.5W across power range at calibrated frequencies.
- Wideband: Cover wider frequency and power bands with fewer instruments.
- Confidence: Digital display and no elements mitigate measurement errors.

The Gemini Series meters provide flexibility and freedom. The meters are powered by a standard USB 2.0 port, external battery, or AC power outlet using off-the-shelf USB adapters. And since the meter is built-in, there is less equipment – and less cables – to carry to the field or bench.

Real-time readings and data collection increase user productivity and process efficiency. Measurement data can be collected directly on a compatible PC for remote monitoring, review, or audit. Measurements are quicker and more reliable with the single, self-contained 5540A, maximizing productivity.

For over 30 years, TEGAM has been building RF measurement instruments for challenging applications. The TEGAM Gemini Series RF Power Meter family – experience and innovation realized.

Prices and specifications subject to change without notice.

When the Measurement Matters, Be Certain with TEGAM.
