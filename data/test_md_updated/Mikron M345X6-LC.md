# Factory Calibration Services

We know that your Advanced Energy equipment plays a critical role in your process and research. Precision is imperative. We’ve established a fully equipped, expertly staffed laboratory for performing calibrations that meet national standards. We offer two types of calibration services for our infrared products:

# Calibration Services

|Standard|Two-point calibration|
|---|---|
|Certified|Five-point calibration (or more) and NIST certification|

These additional services require a return materials authorization (RMA) number. They can be purchased as needed or as part of a calibration contract.
