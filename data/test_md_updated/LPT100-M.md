# ARTESYN LPT100-M SERIES

130 Watts

Advanced Energy's Artesyn LPT100-M series of triple output Data Sheet open-frame AC-DC power supplies features ITE and medical safety approvals. There is a choice of four models, covering output voltages from 3.3 V to 24 V. The power supplies have a typical full load power conversion efficiency of 82% and with a height of only 1.28 inches offer a power density in excess of 12 watts per cubic inch. LPT100-M power supplies are primarily designed for use in information technology equipment (ITE) and light industrial systems, as well as for equipment intended for non-patient contact and non-patient critical use in low power medical, dental and laboratory applications.
