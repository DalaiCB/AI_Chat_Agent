# TREK 323

Highly sensitive versatile instrument used for a variety of electrostatic applications including material evaluation, electret studies, charge accumulation, etc.

The Trek® 323 electrostatic voltmeter performs highly sensitive voltage measurements using a variety of Trek sideview probes with various body types (round, square). The Trek 323 is specifically designed for high sensitivity applications and performs highly accurate, non-contacting measurement of electrostatic potentials of 0 to 100 V over a wide range of probe-to-surface distances. The Trek 323 is a versatile instrument used for a variety of electrostatic applications including materials evaluation, electret studies, charge accumulation on disk drive assemblies, and other extremely sensitive ESD sensitive components.

# AT A GLANCE

|Measurement Range|0 to ±100 VDC or peak AC|
|---|---|
|Sensitivity|5 mV|
|Speed of Response|Less than 300 ms for a 100 V step|

# PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS

- Response speed control adjusts the speed/noise trade-off of the AC response
- Drift/spacing null adjustment minimizes the variation in zero offset voltage as the probe-to-test surface spacing changes
- Easy-to-read front panel 3.5 digit LED display
- Monitor the detected output voltage through a 1:1 voltage monitor output and a switch selectable scale of 10:1 or 20:1 voltage monitor output
- Patented low impedance probes assure measurement accuracy essentially independent of probe-to-test-surface spacing, humidity conditions, and contamination such as airborne dust, toner, ions and chemicals
- NIST-traceable Certificate of Calibration provided with each unit
