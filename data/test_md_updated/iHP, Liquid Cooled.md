ORDERING INFORMATION (CONTINUED)

MODEL NUMBER SHORTCUT

For repeated like modules in parallel or series, instead of listing all the same modules separated by a "-", you can simply list the module once and then follow by the number of times it repeats enclosed in parenthesis.

For example:

iHP20SH3L-S8-S8-S8-S8-S8-S8-S8-S8-DP

would become:

iHP20SH3LC-S8(8)-DP

EXAMPLE OF CREATING A PART NUMBER

If a 300V @ 67A output was desired, the best choice would be using four 80V modules tied in series which have a programming range of 4V to 96V so in series the range is 16V to 384V. To get the current required then tie 2 groups of these series modules into parallel. The final part number would be iHP20SH3LC-S2(8)-RS-1P.
