# ARTESYN LPS40 SERIES

40 W LPS40

# AT A GLANCE

|Total Power:|25 to 40 W|
|---|---|
|Input Voltage:|85 to 264 VAC|
| |120 to 300 VDC|
|# of Outputs:|Single|

Advanced Energy’s Artesyn LPS40 series of open-frame comprises four single output models, offering voltages of 5 V, 12 V, 15 V or 24 V. Each model accepts a universal input of 85 to 264 VAC or 120 to 300 VDC. All four feature medical safety approvals, with a very low safety ground leakage current of less than 75 mA. These compact switch-mode power supplies feature output overvoltage and short-circuit protection, as well as remote sense. They provide 40 W of output power with free air convection cooling and 55 watts with 30 CFM of forced air. Less than 1U high, LPS40 power supplies are designed for medical, test and measurement, single-board computers, telecommunications and networking applications.
