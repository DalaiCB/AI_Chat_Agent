# OUTPUT VOLTAGE ADJUSTMENT

The ultra-wide output voltage trim range offers major advantages to users who select the SMT15E-05W3V3J. It is no longer necessary to purchase a variety of modules in order to cover different output voltages. The output voltage can be trimmed in a range of 0.8 Vdc to 3.63 Vdc. When the SMT15E-05W3V3J converter leaves the factory the output has been adjusted to the default voltage of 3.3 V.

- When Vin ≥ 4.5 V, then Vout can be adjusted from 0.8 Vdc to 3.6 Vdc
- When Vin < 4.5 V, then Vout can be adjusted from 0.8 Vdc to 2.75 Vdc

Notes:

1. When Vin ≥ 4.5 V, then Vout can be adjusted from 0.8 Vdc to 3.63 Vdc. When Vin < 4.5 V, then Vout can be adjusted from 0.8 Vdc to 2.75 Vdc.
2. The SMT15E features a ‘Negative Logic’ Remote ON/OFF operation. If not using the Remote ON/OFF pin, leave the pin open (the converter will be on). The Remote ON/OFF pin is referenced to ground. The following conditions apply for the SMT15E:
|Configuration|Converter Operation|
|---|---|
|Remote pin open circuit|Unit is ON|
|Remote pin pulled low|Unit is ON|
|Remote pin pulled high [Von/off >1.2 V]|Unit is OFF|
3. Full derating curves available in both the Longform Datasheet and Application Note 136.
4. When the unit is trimmed down to 0.8 V, the efficiency is 82.5%.
5. NOTICE: Some models do not support all options. Please contact your local Artesyn representative or use the on-line model number search tool at http://www.artesyn.com to find a suitable alternative.
