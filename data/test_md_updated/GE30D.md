# Protection

Overvoltage Protection

Overload Protection

Short Circuit Protection

Overtemperature Protection

V1: 115 to 155% of nominal, latch mode, requires AC recycle to reset.

V2: 115% to 155% of nominal, USB has a “Cut-out switch” latch protection, requires AC recycle to reset.

V1: 110 to 150% of rating, constant current, then hiccup mode, auto-recovery

V2: 130 to 180% of rating, constant current, recovery

V1: Hiccup mode, auto-recovery.

V2: Constant current, auto-recovery.

If the second output is short circuited or overloaded, the first output will continue to operate normally.

If the first output is short circuited or overloaded, it is not required that the second output continues to operate normally.

Will shutdown upon an over temperature condition, auto-recovery
