PSON #

The PSON# signal is required to remotely turn on/off the power supply. PSON# is an active low signal that turns on the +12 VDC power rail. When this signal is not pulled low by the system, or left open, the +12 VDC output turns off. The 5.0 VSB output remains on. This signal is pulled to a standby voltage by a pull-up resistor internal to the power supply. The power supply fan(s) shall operate at the lowest speed.

PWOK# (Power Good)

PWOK is a power good signal and will assert HIGH when the outputs are within the regulation limits. PWOK will be pulled LOW by the power supply to indicate when either output falls below regulation limits or when AC power has been removed for a time sufficiently long so that power supply operation is no longer guaranteed. The start of the PWOK# delay time shall be inhibited as long as the +12 VDC output is in current limit or the 5.0 VSB output is below the regulation limit.

|PSON Signal Characteristics| |PWOK Signal Characteristics| | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Signal Type|Accepts an open collector/drain input from the system.|Signal Type|Open collector/drain output from power supply.| | |
|PSON# = Low|ON|PWOK = High|Power Good| | |
|PSON# = Open|OFF|PWOK = Low|Power Not Good| | |
|MIN|MAX|MIN|MAX| | |
|Logic level low (power supply ON)|0 V|0.8 V|Logic level low voltage, Ising = 4 mA|0 V|0.8 V|
|Logic level high (power supply OFF)|2.0 V|4.125 V|Logic level high voltage, Isource = 200 μA|2.0 V|4.125 V|

# OUTPUTS - ALL MODELS (CONTINUED)

PSKILL AC INPUT PRESENT INDICATOR (ACOK#)

The +12 VDC output only from the power supply shall be disabled if the PSKILL input is high and V Standby will continue to be provided, outputs may be enabled if this signal is low. The power supply includes a pull up to disable all outputs if this signal is open. PSKILL shall not be connected during a hot insertion before all of the other pins are connected.

The ACOK# signal is used to indicate the presence of AC input to the power supply. This signal shall be connected to 5.0 VSB through a resistor on the host system side. A logic “High” level on this signal shall indicate AC input to the power supply is present. A Logic “Low” on this signal shall indicate a loss of AC input to the power supply.

# STATUS INDICATIONS

See table below for Summary of Status signals, Ports, and Indicators. The condition column assumes 2 or more power supplies present and ON and 5.0 VSB shared for the management interface. On the “Fan Blocked” condition, the assumption is that all outputs are within spec and not over temperature. This would be considered a “warning” condition. On the “Standby” condition, the system differentiates this state by knowing PS_ONL in negated (requesting Standby).

|Signal Type|Pull up to 5.0 VSB through a resistor in the host system.|
|---|---|
|PWOK|High - Present|
|PWOK|Low - Not Present|
| |MIN - MAX|
|Logic level low voltage, Isink = 4 mA|0 V - 0.8 V|
|Logic level high voltage, Isink = 50 μA|2.0 V - 4.125 V|
