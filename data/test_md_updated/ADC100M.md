Advanced Energy’s Artesyn ADC100M-04 is a Direct Conversion PSA main unit. With the ever increasing power demands of server processors and associated memory devices, new power conversion design approaches need to be considered both at system and server level. The solution to achieve the high power required is to move to a 48 V system with the power conversion design approaches of either distributed power conversion, or direct power conversion employed in the server. ADC100 series follow Power Stamp Alliance’s standard product footprint and functions that provide a standard modular board-mounted solution for power conversion for 48 Vin / 54 Vin to low voltage, high current applications.
