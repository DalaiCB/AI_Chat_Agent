# ARTESYN 48 V 30 KW EIA 19" POWER SHELVES

30 kW (10 + 2) Redundancy

Advanced Energy's Artesyn introduces the 30 kW stand-alone Power Shelf, single voltage 48 VDC output, powered from three-phase AC line. The Power Shelf sits in a 2RU high slot in a EIA 19” rack, which hosts twelve power modules with the outputs connected in parallel. Each module is an AC/DC power converter rated at 3000 W, 48 VDC of nominal output power, hot-swappable, accurate current sharing and is self-cooled. The shelf will power the IT system through the OCP compatible busbar.

Output / Bus Bar Interface

The power shelf mates with the 48 V bus bars which are mounted to the rack. The output bus bars use slots to slide into the clinch studs that are mounted to the vertical bus bars.

The busbars and power shelf to busbar interface are defined by using the lower surface of the lowest square mount hole as DATUM A. Also, the front surface of the rack mount posts (where the server “ears” contact) are DATUM B.
