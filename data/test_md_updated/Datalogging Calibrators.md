TEGAM 948A Datalogging TJC Calibrator

|NEW CHALLENGES|require new tools. TEGAM has rethought temperature calibrators to offer you the performance you need today without complicating your work. The new 940 Series provides laboratory grade calibrations in a highly portable package that goes to the work-site with ease. Industries that measure temperature are being pushed to achieve better results for both quality and product safety. TEGAM has responded by designing an instrument that leads its class in terms of accuracy, battery life, convenience and ease of use. When you venture out into the field or plant to perform service work, you need a durable tool that you can count on. TEGAM has over 30 years of experience building hand held instruments for challenging environments. That’s why we designed the 940 series to meet MIL-PRF-28800F for shock, drop and vibration tests. The keypad is a sealed design that rejects fluids and dirt without compromising tactile feedback. No matter how good the tool is, it is useless with dead batteries. We gave the 940 Series exceptional 10X battery life of its competitors with 3 AA batteries so that you aren’t disappointed in the field.|
|---|---|
|More stringent calibration requirements drive the need for better tools. Tighter process controls and quality standards mean your old calibrator doesn’t measure up anymore. TEGAM has designed the most accurate calibrator in a portable package. While it is difficult to recreate the temperature controlled environment that a lab provides, you can use an instrument that delivers laboratory grade accuracy with clear specifications that let you determine the exact level of field performance you do achieve. TEGAM’s new 940 Series calibrators compensate for the ambient temperature. This allows you to perform calibrations with confidence in diverse conditions.|- Laboratory Accuracy ±5 μV based on recommended calibration cycle
- Resolution: 0.01°
- 10x Battery Life
- Simultaneous Source / Measure
- MIL-STD Durability
- Easy One Hand Operation
- Calibration Report Included
- Meets SAE AMS 2750E requirements as a secondary standard instrument
- Assembled in USA

Prices and specifications subject to change without notice. 948A-909 Rev. AA The app-based data-logging feature of the TEGAM 948A calibrator allows users to accurately record and store time-stamped measurements at the touch of a button, review them and transfer them, using Bluetooth® low energy technology, via a mobile device or PC, to local or cloud storage at their convenience. This seamless connectivity allows the user to collect, transmit and store accurate temperature data for analysis or compliance reporting without any additional or third-party software. A highly capable instrument can often imply complexity. TEGAM engineers appreciate simplicity and designed the 940 Series to be easier to use than the competitors. Our goal was to make the technician productive when they first picked up the instrument. With one key, the user can perform a 10% / 90% calibration without reading the manual. Another key increments 0%/25%/50%/75%/100% for rapid 5 point checks. Setting any specific temperature is equally easy as are step and ramp modes. Like all TEGAM products, the 900 Series calibrators are designed, assembled and tested in the United States. TEGAM backs this durable instrument with a standard 3–year warranty to assure you that your investment is sound. When the Measurement Matters, Be Certain with TEGAM.
