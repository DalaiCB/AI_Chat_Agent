# TREK 10/10B-HS

High voltage power amplifier capable of precise control of output voltages with an all-solid-state design for high slew rate, wide bandwidth, and low-noise operation.

Trek® 10/10B-HS is a DC stable high-speed, high voltage power amplifier capable of precise control of output voltages. It features an all-solid-state design for high slew rate, wide bandwidth, and low-noise operation. The four-quadrant, active output stage sinks or sources current into reactive or resistive loads throughout the output voltage range. This is essential for monitoring the accurate output response and high slew rates when driving reactive loads.
