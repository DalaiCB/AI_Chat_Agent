# OPTICS

The IGAR 320 has fixed optics for 300 mm or 800 mm measuring distances.

# ALIGNING WITH VARIOMETER LEDS

The alignment of the IGAR 320 to the measuring object is possible with the built-in aiming light or by using the Variometer LEDs, which are located on the back of the device. These Variometer LEDs indicate when there is a change in thermal intensity.

The green LED indicates operational readiness
The blue LED indicates falling thermal intensity
The red LED indicates rising thermal intensity

# INFRAWIN 5 OVERVIEW

InfraWin is easy-to-use measurement and evaluation software for remote configuration of stationary, digital Impac brand pyrometers.

This software allows the user to remotely adjust and control settings for one or two pyrometers from a single computer. InfraWin also allows the user to simultaneously monitor and control temperatures.

- Display temperature data as color bars and online graphics
- Capture downstream evaluations as tables, graphics, or text files
- Calculate the spot size for different measuring distances
- Features UPP standard (Universal Pyrometer Protocol)

# Pyrometer Settings

An Impac digital pyrometer connected to a PC will be automatically detected by the software. All available parameters are adjustable, including emissivity, response time, maximum value storage, output signal, and sub-range.

Further special functions are adjustable, for example, controllers or TV parameters on instruments available with these functions. Changes are transmitted directly to the pyrometer.

# Measurement with Internal Temperature

In this window, a temperature value for the upper or lower limit can be adjusted numerically or with the mouse. The acquired minimum and maximum value is indicated as well as the inner temperature of the pyrometer. The emissivity is changeable during the measurement at any time.

# Infrared Calculator

After input of the aperture and the focused spot size per datasheet, the calculation of spot sizes at non-focused distances is possible.

|Measurement with Color Bar|82.9°C|
|---|---|
|104.7°C| |
|110.0°C| |

I/O Module allows users to trigger measurement externally and gives a potential free output contact.
