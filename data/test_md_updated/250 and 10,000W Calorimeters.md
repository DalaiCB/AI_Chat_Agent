50 Hz to 3000 MHz¹ frequency range

National Lab traceable through an AC Power Standard

Known as the calorie. A calorie is defined as the amount of energy, in the form of heat, required to raise the temperature of a certain mass of liquid by a given amount.

By accurately measuring temperature and mass we can determine the amount of heat and therefore, the amount of energy applied to the liquid. This process results in unprecedented uncertainties for high-power RF measurements.

TEGAM’s calorimeters can self-calibrate with National Lab traceability through an AC power standard using the included calorimeter calibration software. They can also be configured to calibrate working standards, through meters, and terminating devices. By combining either calorimeter with TEGAM’s low-pass filter banks, high-power switching systems, and workload calibration software, the entire measurement process can be automated.

# Turnkey Systems Available

TEGAM has condensed its experience with high-power RF calibration into convenient and accurate automated systems that operate from 50 Hz up to 3000 MHz, at power levels up to 10,000 W¹. Each turnkey package is designed and built according to your requirements, and may include a calorimeter, filter banks, RF switches, signal sources, transfer standards, and amplifiers as appropriate. Our package components have been tested and verified by TEGAM to produce accurate and repeatable automated calibrations. Onsite installation and training are available for a fast and trouble-free start up. Due to the wide range of configuration options, turnkey packages are quoted on an as-requested basis.

# Applications

- RF Source Measurement: Measure RF power output from plasma generators and other high-power sourcing devices.
- RF Transfer Standards: Reduce the time required to make precision RF measurements while maintaining high accuracy by calibrating transfer standards. Use the 1314 or 1316A to calibrate transfer standards such as the TEGAM 2601A and 2602A for faster verification of your daily workload.
- In Situ Power Meters: Where process accuracy matters, calibrate in situ devices directly on the calorimeter for the best-possible uncertainty.
- Amplifiers: Calibrate RF amplifier outputs up to 10,000 W with unparalleled measurement uncertainty. Note that source harmonics must be < -40 dBc to maintain best measurement uncertainties.

For over 30 years, TEGAM has been building RF measurement instruments for challenging applications. The TEGAM High Power Precision Calorimeter family - experience and innovation realized.

The 1314 and 1316A are intended for use as primary standards. Measurement repeatability and uncertainties will vary among laboratories depending upon various factors, including ambient environment, user experience, and elapsed time since the most recent system calibration. TEGAM will provide guidance where possible, but users are ultimately responsible for establishing their own measurement uncertainties consistent with the laboratory’s capabilities.

Other AC Input voltage ratings available as appropriate for the end-user’s local power specifications.

Assumes proper preparations are followed prior to storage, including draining the coolant system. See manual for details.

Optional 3-1/8” connector may increase transfer uncertainties if using adaptors to calibrate non-3-1/8” devices.
