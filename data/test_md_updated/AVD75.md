# ARTESYN AVD75 SERIES

|75 Watts|1|1|
|---|---|---|
| |282| |

Advanced Energy's Artesyn AVD75 series of sixteenth-brick isolated DC-DC converters comprises two single output models offering fully regulated voltages of 1.2 V or 3.3 V, rated at 25 amps and 20 amps respectively. Both converters have a wide 2:1 input range of 36 to 75 Vdc and are designed primarily for use with standard 48 V telecommunications equipment supplies. Rated at 75 watts, they employ an open-frame construction, offer up to 91% efficiency and accommodate an ambient operating temperature range of -40 to 85˚C. A baseplate option is available for enhanced thermal performance. The converters use fixed frequency switching to minimize the need for external EMI filtering.
