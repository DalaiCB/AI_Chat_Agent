# ARTESYN AGF600-48S50P SERIES

600 Watts

Advanced Energy's Artesyn AGF600 series of isolated DC-DC converters is designed for RF applications such as medium power wireless base stations. This series of converters offers two wide input range models. The AGF600-24 accepts an 18 to 36 Vdc input, while the AGF600-48 accepts a 36 to 75 Vdc input. Both models provide a regulated low noise 28 Vdc output that can deliver up to 21.5 amps. Rated at 600 watts, they can operate over an ambient temperature range of -40 to 85˚C, continuing to deliver full power up to a baseplate temperature of 100˚C. The converters use a 320 kHz fixed frequency switching to minimize EMI filtering needs.
