# ARTESYN CSU SERIES 1800W to 2400W 12V Distributed Power System

Advanced Energy’s Artesyn CSU front end series is designed to provide a flexible power conversion solution for compute, storage, and networking equipment in the common redundant power supply (CRPS) form factor. This series of AC-DC products is housed in the industry standard 1U x 73.5 mm x 185 mm CRPS form factor. Featuring individual power ratings from 550 W up to 2400 W, the choice for power supplies can cover cost-sensitive entry level systems, or power hungry applications where there are space constraints. Designed to provide the highest power in the smallest form factor, the series offers class-leading power density of 75 W/in3. The common form, fit, and function for all products in the family provides a path for power capacity flexibility, future-proofing your system designs.
