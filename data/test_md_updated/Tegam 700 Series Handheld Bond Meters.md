# Model 710A BOND METER

Handheld Bond Measurements From the Low Resistance Experts. The only highly-portable bond meter made in the U.S.A that offers superior accuracy, 100–hour battery life, and a 3–year warranty.

TEGAM 710A Bond Meter TEGAM’s new 700 Series bond meters are instruments you can rely on every day with confidence. These new models are designed with the clearest and most informative displays for mistake-free usage. They quickly produce accurate readings to reduce the time spent measuring.

TEGAM is the largest producer of bond meters for airframe testing of the finest low resistance measurements instruments in the world. We combined this experience into the smallest size bond meter that you can take with you anywhere on an airframe with ease. We also developed unique low power techniques so that you don’t have to deal with power cords or battery chargers. The 710A/720A will run for 100 hours on 3 standard AA batteries and has auto power off to preserve them. The battery health is clearly indicated so that you have ample warning for replacement.

PROBES are often more important than the instrument. No one has a wider range of configurations to meet and adapt to your needs. From tight spacing to piercing paint, we have a handle and tip combination for virtually all applications. You can mix styles to make your job easier. The dual connector system permits a Kelvin Clip on one lead for secure ground connection while the ergonomic tri-shape probe on the second lead can be used for accessing multiple points with one hand.
