# IMPAC IN 5/9 PLUS

Digital pyrometer for non-contact temperature measurement of sapphire and sapphire wafers between 0 and 1500°C (32 and 2732°F).

The Impac® IN 5/9 plus infrared thermometer is specially designed for non-contact temperature measurement of sapphire and sapphire wafers between 0 and 1500°C. The instrument is a pyrometer equipped with a digital interface, enabling temperature indication and storage on a PC. A temperature sub-range can be configured, and the instrument parameters can be adjusted remotely.

For optimal match of the instrument to the application (size of the measuring object, distance), different optics are available. For a precise alignment of the pyrometer to the measuring object, the instrument is equipped with a laser targeting light.

# INSTRUMENT SETTINGS

The most important parameters such as emissivity, exposure time, and analog output can be set directly in the instrument. After removing the cover on the back side of the pyrometer, the corresponding adjustments are available.

|Housing|Cover|
|---|---|
|Emissivity ε|Exposure Time t90|
|Analog output 0 or 4 to 20 mA|Online / Offline|
|Electrical Connection|Adjustments|

The instrument can alternatively be switched to online mode to enable the communication via serial interface and software InfraWin (in scope of delivery) on a PC. This allows additional setting options as well as the graphical temperature display combined with subsequent analysis of the measurement values.

# INFRAWIN 5 OVERVIEW

InfraWin is easy-to-use measurement and evaluation software for remote configuration of stationary, digital Impac brand pyrometers.

This software allows the user to remotely adjust and control settings for one or two pyrometers from a single computer. InfraWin also allows the user to simultaneously monitor and control temperatures.

- Display temperature data as color bars and online graphics
- Capture downstream evaluations as tables, graphics, or text files
- Calculate the spot size for different measuring distances
- Features UPP standard (Universal Pyrometer Protocol)

# Pyrometer Settings

An Impac digital pyrometer connected to a PC will be automatically detected by the software. All available parameters are adjustable, including emissivity, response time, maximum value storage, output signal, and sub-range.

Further special functions are adjustable, for example, controllers or TV parameters on instruments available with these functions. Changes are transmitted directly to the pyrometer.

# Measurement with Color Bar

In this window, a temperature value for the upper or lower limit can be adjusted numerically or with the mouse. The acquired minimum and maximum value is indicated as well as the inner temperature of the pyrometer. The emissivity is changeable during the measurement at any time.

# Infrared Calculator

After input of the aperture and the focused spot size per datasheet, the calculation of spot sizes at non-focused distances is possible.

# Measurement with Internal Temperature

Measurement with Internal Temperature of radiation temperature and internal instrument temperature. Parameters can be changed during the measurement.

I/O Module allows users to trigger measurement externally and gives a potential free output contact.
