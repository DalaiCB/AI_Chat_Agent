Intrinsically Safe Intrinsic safety means the instrument is specifically designed and tested to prevent the release of energy that could ignite flammable liquids or gases in the work area. The Model R1L-E2A is an intrinsically safe, portable microohmmeter/bond tester for measuring low values of resistance (from 100 μΩ to 20 Ω) in these potentially explosive atmospheres.

Applications include:
- Aircraft bond measurements for all phases of aircraft manufacturing and flight line maintenance in the presence of JP4 and aviation gasoline.
- Verifying natural gas pipe grounds and bonds.
- Checking pharmaceutical equipment grounds and storage facilities in the presence of alcohol.
- Inspecting lighting arrestors in petrochemical production and distribution facilities.

Predictable Results The R1L-E2A combines accurate measurement, simple operation, and durable construction to provide consistent, predictable results under a challenging range of conditions. It is designed to accurately measure microohms throughout the widest operating temperature range of any commercially available bond meter.

A rugged and waterproof case contains and protects the R1L-E2A when being transported to and from the work site. The case doubles as a storage area for the probes that are included as standard equipment with every instrument and an integral part of the intrinsic safety system.

Is it Right for You? The R1L-E2A was selected as the standard bond meter for the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter after a competitive test. It goes into service with each squadron of F-35’s anywhere in the world under all conditions. The combination of intrinsic safety and durability should qualify it for your bond measurements as well. If your requirements aren’t quite that demanding, TEGAM manufactures a complete line of rugged and portable bond meters for your unique measurement challenge. You may see the complete line at tegam.com.

# Included Accessories

The R1L-E2A is available with two different styles of probes, dependent upon the application.

The HTP-101A probes are wired with 8 ft of #12 AWG cable and contain two stainless steel spring loaded pins that rotate as they are depressed to punch through corrosion and coatings. The pins are 0.158 in diameter and the pin center to pin center is 0.5 in (1.27 cm). NSN: 6625-01-527-5543 is configured to come with the HTP-101A probes.

The R1L-E2A/SKP-8 comes with a smaller probe for working in more confined spaces. The SKP-8 probes come with an 8 ft cable and terminate in color-coded spade lugs. The spacing between the pins is 0.19 in and the probe handle length is 5.5 in.

Both probes are part of the Intrinsically Safe system. The probes are molded with a conductive additive to prevent the building of dangerous static electricity.
