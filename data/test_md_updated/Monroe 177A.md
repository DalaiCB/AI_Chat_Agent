# MONROE 177A

Accurate and dependable continuous monitoring of the critical points in a facility to detect and warn of electrostatic charge build-up before it becomes a problem.

The Monroe 177A serves as a full-time, plant-wide automatic static build-up monitor. As static levels in your application surpass a preset value, beyond which there may be danger to personnel or possible disruption or destruction to the process or product, an initial warning is triggered and the process is allowed to continue. If the problem is rectified, the warning returns to a normal state. If the condition persists and the static level exceeds a second more crucial value, an alarm is activated and terminates the process until corrective action is taken and the system is reset.

# AT A GLANCE

Analog Outputs (Selectable)

±10 V, 0 to 5 V (2.5 V, ±2.5 V full scale); < 10 W impedance; or simultaneous 4 to 20 mA (optional)

# PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS

- Intrinsically safe sensor operation (with optional barriers) in explosive atmospheres
- Four channel static monitor detects static levels in as many as four locations up to 1000 feet away
- Accurate and drift-free measurement including ionized environments
- Provides analog outputs and control via RS232/485 and front panel
- Built-in, fully configurable dual level alarms programmable via front panel, PC, or PLC
- Cascade up to 32 units via RS485 providing 128 sensor locations
- PLC compatible using Modbus protocol
- Password security

Accuracy

±3% of full scale at analog output

±3% of full scale, ±2 counts

+0.3 counts/°C at front panel meters

Displays

Four 3½ digit LEDs, 0.6 in (one per input channel)

# TYPICAL APPLICATIONS
