# TREK 152-1

Resistance meter designed to precisely measure surface or volume resistance on a wide variety of conductive, dissipative, and insulative materials.

The Trek® 152-1 surface/volume resistance meter is designed to precisely measure surface or volume resistance on a wide variety of conductive, dissipative, and insulative materials. It features exceptional measurement accuracy and wide measurement ranges. When used with Advanced Energy's uniquely-designed 152P-CR-1 concentric ring probe, the instrument provides consistent ease of operation even at very high resistance values. The Trek 152-1 is lightweight, portable and operable via batteries or an AC line power source with battery eliminator.

# Test Probes/Accessories

- Trek 152BP-5P Test Probes
- Trek 152P-2P Two-Point Resistance Probe
- Trek 152P-CR-1 Surface/Volume Concentric Ring Probe1
- Test Plate Set (consists of two separate plates)
- Walking Test Adapter Kit

Set of 2 (2.27 kg / 5 lb). Available for performing resistance measurements including ANSI/ESD STM 4.1 standards (point-to-point or resistance to ground measurement). Performs measurements on surface areas too small to be measured with conventional probes.

Measures surface and volume resistance of materials as per IEC or ESDA standards. A three (3) position switch on the probe selects either SURFACE distance or VOLUME resistance measurements with either a GUARDED or UNGUARDED outer electrode. Uses an exclusive built-in pre-amplifier design.

The use of these plates is described in the ESD STM 11.12 (IEC 61340-2-3) standard.

|Conductive Plate|127 x 127 mm (5 x 5 in) A stainless steel conductive plate with a mini banana plug|
|---|---|
|Insulative Plate|137 x 137 mm (5.4 x 5.4 in) Acts as an insulative surface|

The Walking Test Adapter allows the analysis of resistance levels on the human body (STM 97.1)

1 The Trek 152-CR-1 will operate with the previous Trek 152 resistivity meter in “surface” mode, just as the Trek152-CR probe did. The 152-CR will operate with the Trek152-1 Resistance Meter with the measurement being in “ohms,” not “ohms/sq.”
