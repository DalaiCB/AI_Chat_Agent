Notes:

1. Measured at the output connector, with noise probe directly across output and load terminated with 0.1 μF ceramic and 10 μF low ESR capacitors. For 5 V and 6 V models, values listed are typical 100 mV pk-pk maximum with 0.1 μF ceramic and 47 μF low ESR capacitors used at measurement point.

2. For input Class I models: For AC GND connected to output common (-), insert a “B” in the part number where the “A” is located (ME30B1203F01).

3. Order blade kit KT-1027K for other blades (EU, UK, Australia).

4. For EU fixed blades, replace “C” in the model number with “M”, for UK blades, replace “C” with “G”, for Australia blades, replace “C” with “H”.

5. All specifications are typical at nominal input, full load, at 25°C ambient unless noted.
