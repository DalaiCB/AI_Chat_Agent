# TREK 320C

Versatile instrument used for a variety of electrostatic applications including contact potential measurements, materials evaluation, and electret studies.

The Trek® 320C makes highly accurate, noncontacting measurement of electrostatic potentials of 1 mV to 100 V over a wide range of probe-to-surface distances. The Trek 320C is specifically designed for high sensitivity applications. The Trek 320C has adjustments to compensate for many sensitive testing conditions. A calibrated null voltage supply of ±10 volts nulls contact potentials when measuring voltages on dissimilar materials. The null voltage source may be used to null different work function voltages of the test surface or to function as a zero suppression voltage source.

# AT A GLANCE

|Measurement Range|0 to ±100 V DC or peak AC|
|---|---|
|Sensitivity|1 mV|
|Speed of Response|Less than 300 ms for a 100 V step|
|Measurement Accuracy|Better than 0.05% of full scale|
|Null Voltage Source|10 volt nulling supply for contact potential measurements|
|Response Speed Control|AC response adjusted for speed/noise|
|Drift Spacing/Null Adjustment|Minimizes variations in voltage values as probe-to-test surface spacing changes|

# PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS

- Response speed control adjusts the speed/noise trade-off of the Trek 320C AC response
- Self-locking drift/spacing null adjustment minimizes the variation in monitored voltage values as the probe to test surface spacing changes
- Easy-to-read front panel 3.5 digit LED display
- Monitor the detected output voltage through a 1:1 voltage monitor output and a switch selectable scale of 10:1 or 20:1 voltage monitor output
- Patented low impedance probe assures measurement accuracy which is essentially independent of probe-to-test-surface spacing while eliminating the external environmental effects of high humidity and contamination, such as airborne dust, toner, ions and chemicals, on measurement accuracy.
- NIST-traceable Certificate of Calibration provided with each unit
