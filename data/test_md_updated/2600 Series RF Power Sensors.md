TEGAM Temperature Stabilized Coaxial RF Power Transfer Standards enable the precise measurement of high power (+34 to +54 dBm) microwave power in the 700 to 3500 MHz frequency range. The TEGAM 2602A working standards are constructed of a directional coupler paired with a 1505A thermistor power standard. The design has the coupler and 1505A mounted on an aluminum heat sink to reduce changes in coupling factor attributable to heating. These standards are highly accurate and stable with time and temperature. They are ideal for use as standards for the transfer of calibration factors to other high power RF standards and power sensors.

The calibration of these standards is traceable to the International System of Units (SI) through the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) or other recognized National Metrology Institutes.

These RF Power Standards work with TEGAM’s 1830A RF Power Meter.

System configurations employing instruments of this accuracy typically achieve calibration factor transfer results better than primary standards laboratories.

The Model 2602A is a feedthrough thermistor standard used for the calibration of Watt Meters as well as other high power RF power sensing sensors.

The Model 2602A features a Type N female connector.
