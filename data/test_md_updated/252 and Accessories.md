Digital Impedance Meter Model 253 Range

Phone Auto ABEE

TEGAM Models 252 and 253 are used for evaluating and inspecting components. These meters provide direct, digital display of inductance, capacitance, resistance, conductance, and dissipation. They have the versatility and basic measurement accuracy (0.25%), to satisfy demanding engineering and inspection applications, while being extremely easy to use.

The Model 253 has all of the above characteristics, an auto-ranging feature, and includes one additional measurement range for C and G. An optional battery power pack (252/SP2596 or 253/SP2598) is available on both versions. This allows these meters to be used with line power when available and unplugged when convenient or necessary.

Simply push the button for the desired function, set the range and connect to the unknown. True four-terminal connections are ensured by the standard Kelvin Klip® test leads. The measurement is displayed on the large 3½-digit readout.
