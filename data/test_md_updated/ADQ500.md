# ARTESYN ADQ500 SERIES

500 Watt Quarter Brick DC-DC Converter

ADQ500 series quarter-brick isolated DC-DC converters DATA SHEET produce a single fully regulated 12 V output. Rated at 500 watts, these converters can deliver up to 42 amps output current and have no minimum load requirement. They have an input voltage range of 36 to 75 V and are primarily designed for use with standard 48 V supplies in computing and server applications, as well as regulated 48V supplies in communications equipment.
