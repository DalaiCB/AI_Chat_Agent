# ARTESYN OCP ORV2 COMPLIANT POWER SHELF

Open Compute Project (OCP), Open Rack v.2 ORV2

# DATA SHEET

Advanced Energy introduces 6,600W V2 power shelf which is powered from a three-phase system and has a 12V main output. The power shelf includes three 3,300W (N+1) hot swappable V2 power modules and three battery backup units. The backup is provided by battery backup modules which are installed in the same shelf.

This power shelf is typically used for compute and storage applications to provide reliable power and battery backup functions.
