# ADO500 SERIES

500 - 550 Watt 1/8 Brick DC-DC Converter

ADO500/550 series eighth-brick isolated DC-DC converters DATA SHEET produce a single fully regulated 10 V output. Rated at 500/550 watts, these converters can deliver up to 55 amps output current and have no minimum load requirement. They have an input voltage range of 45 to 56 V and are primarily designed for use with standard 48 V supplies in computing and server applications, as well as regulated 48V supplies in communications equipment.
