# ARTESYN SMT05E SERIES 12 V Non-Isolated DC-DC Converters

Advanced Energy's Artesyn SMT05E_12V series non-isolated DC-DC converter accepts a 10 to 14 Vdc input and produces an output that can be trimmed over a very wide 0.8 to 3.63 Vdc range to satisfy a broad diversity of semiconductor power needs. Rated at 16.5 watts, the converter has a typical efficiency of 91% and can deliver up to 5 amps. Standard features include remote On/Off and comprehensive protection against short-circuit and overtemperature conditions. Packaged as a low profile surface-mount module, it has a footprint of 0.45 x 0.8 inch (11.4 x 20.3 mm) and an installed height of only 0.23 inch (5.9 mm).

|---|---|---|
|(5.97)| |(11.43)|

The ultra-wide output voltage trim range offers major advantages to users who select the SMT05E-12W3V3J. It is no longer necessary to purchase a variety of modules in order to cover different output voltages. The output voltage can be trimmed in a range of 0.8 to 3.63 Vdc. When the SMT05E-12W3V3J converter leaves the factory, the output has been adjusted to the default voltage of 0.8 V.

Notes:

1. The SMT05E features a ‘Negative Logic’ Remote ON/OFF operation. If not using the Remote ON/OFF pin, leave the pin open (the converter will be on). The Remote ON/OFF pin is referenced to ground. The following conditions apply for the SMT05E:

|Configuration|Converter Operation|
|---|---|
|Remote pin open circuit|Unit is ON|
|Remote pin pulled low [Von/off 0.8 V]|Unit is OFF|
|Remote pin pulled high [Von/off > 1.6 V]|Unit is ON|

A ‘Negative Logic’ Remote ON/OFF version is also possible with this converter. To order please use part number SMT05E-12W3V3-RJ.
2. Full derating curves available in both the Longform (Technical Reference) and Application Note.
3. NOTICE: Some models do not support all options. Please contact your local Artesyn Embedded Power representative or use the on-line model number search tool at http://www.artesyn.com to find a suitable alternative.
