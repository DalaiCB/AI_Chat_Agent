# eVoSLE

Asymmetric bias waveform generator for direct control of substrate voltage and ion energy

The eVoS LE is an asymmetric bias waveform generator designed to achieve direct control of wafer-surface voltage and resulting ion energy distributions (IED) in plasma-based etch and deposition processes. The eVoS system is comprised of a bi-directional voltage supply combined with an independent current source to establish and control wafer-surface potential. The asymmetric output of the eVoS eliminates the limitations and restrictions of wafer biasing inherent to sinusoidal RF bias application. Fast digital metrology and novel control algorithms enable the production of near mono-energetic IEDs.

# FEATURES

- Ability to produce near mono-energetic ion energy distributions
- Pulse capability with necessary input and output signals for synchronization
- Integrated design and compact size eliminates need for matching network
- High-speed metrology provides real-time bias voltage and ion current feedback
- Adaptable to standard chamber interface

# BENEFITS

- Achieve direct control of wafer bias voltage and resulting ion energies
- Use less power by using the "right power;" only delivering the useful ion energy
- Gain enhanced ion energy selection/discrimination when compared to an RF bias method
