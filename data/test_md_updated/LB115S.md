# SL POWER LB115S SERIES

115 Watts Single Output LED Grade

Advanced Energy’s SL Power LB115S is designed to meet global lighting requirements and has a built-in EMI filter to meet EN55015. All models are CE marked to low voltage directive and approved to safety standard EN60950 2nd edition and UL8750. The versatility of the thermal design of the LB240 offers significant advantages over standard convection or force air cooling alone. The conduction cooled surface provides additional power handling capability while taking advantage of system enclosures as a means to extract heat from the power supply.

# Protection

- Overtemperature Protection
- Overload Protection
- Short Circuit Protection
- Overvoltage Protection

Automatic power shutdown. Thermistor temperature is 130°C 120% to 180% of rated output current value, Hiccup mode. For 12 V output, it is 110 to 180%. Short across the output terminals will not cause damage to the unit. Hiccup mode OVP firing reduces output voltage to <50% of nominal in <50 ms. See "Ordering Information" for trip range
