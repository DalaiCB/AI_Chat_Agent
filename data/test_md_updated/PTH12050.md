# ARTESYN PTH12050 ARTESYN

12 Vin Single Output

Advanced Energy's Artesyn PTH12050 series of non-isolated DC-DC converters complies with the Point-of-Load Alliance (POLA) standard. The converters offer some of the most advanced POL functions in the industry, including Auto-Track™ sequencing for controlled power-up/power-down of complex semiconductor devices such as DSPs, FPGAs, and ASICs. Standard features include pre-bias startup, input undervoltage lockout, remote On/Off, and auto-resetting short-circuit protection.

There are two models in the PTH12050 series of converters, both of which have an input voltage range of 10.8 to 13.2 Vdc. One model offers an output voltage that can be trimmed from 0.8 to 1.8 Vdc, the other has an output that can be trimmed from 1.2 to 5.5 Vdc, enabling a broad diversity of semiconductor power needs to be satisfied. Rated at 33 watts, the converters offer up to 93% efficiency and can deliver up to 6 amps. Available in through-hole horizontal mount and surface-mount versions, they have a small 0.5 x 0.87 inch (12.7 x 22.1 mm) footprint and an installed height of just 0.33 inch (8.5 mm).

# PTH12050

OUTPUT VOLTAGE ADJUSTMENT

The ultra-wide output voltage trim range offers major advantages to users who select the PTH12050. It is no longer necessary to purchase a variety of modules in order to cover different output voltages. The output voltage can be trimmed in a range of 1.2 Vdc to 5.5 Vdc for suffix ‘W’ and 0.8 Vdc to 1.8 Vdc for suffix ‘L’. When the PTH12050 converter leaves the factory the output has been adjusted to the default voltage of 1.2 V for the PTH12050W and 0.8 V for the PTH12050L.

**Efficiency Table: PTH12050W (Io = 5 A)**
|Output Voltage|Efficiency|
|---|---|
|Vo = 5.0 V|93%|
|Vo = 3.3 V|91%|
|Vo = 2.5 V|89%|
|Vo = 2.0 V|88%|
|Vo = 1.8 V|87%|
|Vo = 1.5 V|86%|
|Vo = 1.2 V|84%|

**Efficiency Table: PTH12050L (Io = 5 A)**
|Output Voltage|Efficiency|
|---|---|
|Vo = 1.8 V|88%|
|Vo = 1.5 V|87%|
|Vo = 1.2 V|85%|
|Vo = 1.0 V|83%|
|Vo = 0.8 V|81%|

Notes:

1. Remote ON/OFF. Positive Logic
- ON: Pin 3 open; or V > Vin - 0.5 V
- OFF: Pin 3 GND; or V < 0.8 V (min - 0.2 V).
2. See Figure 1 for safe operating curve.
3. A 100 μF electrolytic input capacitor is required for proper operation. The capacitor must be rated for a minimum of 750 mA rms of ripple current. C2 = 10 μF ceramic capacitor, required for output voltages of 3.3 V and higher.
4. An external output capacitor is not required for basic operation. Adding 100 μF of distributed capacitance at the load will improve the transient response.
5. 1 A/μs load step, 50 to 100% Iomax, Cout = 100 μF.
6. If utilized Vout will track applied voltage by ±0.3 V (up to Vo set point).
7. Tape and reel packaging only available on the surface-mount versions.
8. The pk-pk output ripple voltage is measured with an external 10 μF ceramic capacitor. See Figure 3 for Standard application schematic.
9. NOTICE: Some models do not support all options. Please contact your local Artesyn representative or use the on-line model number search tool at http://www.artesyn.com to find a suitable alternative.
