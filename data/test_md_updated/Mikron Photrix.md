# MIKRON PHOTRIX SERIES

Ultra accurate, digital, and precise infrared thermometers with unmatched low temperature capability. Various temperature ranges between 30 to 2600°C (86 to 4712°F).

The Mikron® PhotriXTM series of infrared thermometers offers best-in-class radiation pyrometry in a robust and flexible package designed for ease of integration. The system can be used as a single channel measurement device or multiple units can be networked together using a mutli-channel interface module. These pyrometers use short wavelength, narrow bandwidth detectors that minimize the effect of emissivity errors and improve accuracy of the measurements. They also offer ambient temperature compensation to combat drift for unmatched long-term stability and reproducibility for long process cycle applications like crystal growth and for repeatable results.

# PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS

# WAVELENGTHS

The PhotriX system is available in five different spectral response ranges. Four of these ranges offer narrow spectral bandpass. Choosing the shortest wavelength possible for an application offers the following benefits:

- Better sensitivity with smaller measurement errors due to emissivity uncertainty
- Enables use of fiber optics in collection optics path
- Ability to measure silicon and other semiconductor materials that are transparent at longer wavelengths

|Code|Spectral Response|Temperature Range| | |Typical Applications| | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| |/065|0.65 μm|Celsius|Fahrenheit| |High temperature metals, solar, SiC| |

# MIKRON PHOTRIX SERIES

# KEY FEATURES

By using both short and narrowband wavelengths, the PhotriX series of pyrometers allows Advanced Energy to push the accuracy of infrared thermometry to the natural limits. The accuracy improvement can be more than an order of magnitude moving from 8 to 14 μm to 0.9 μm (900 nm) measurement wavelengths. Further, the Photrix series’ unmatched signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) allows the measurement of significantly lower temperatures compared to other commercially available sensors using the same short wavelengths.

# MIKRON PHOTRIX SERIES

# OPTICS

The optics capture the thermal radiation from the measurement target and deliver it to the detector. The PhotriX series collection optics can be configured in four distinct forms to better suit an application’s requirements.

|Integrated Lens|For viewing a small spot on a target from a distance, through windows, or through viewports. Spot sizes as small as 0.5 mm with measurements as low as 65°C (0.7 to 1.65 μm) and 270°C (0.9 μm). Standard working distance between 50 and 200 mm that are factory focused to minimize spot size.|
|---|---|
|Direct Lightpipe|The lightpipe is an optical rod constructed of a single crystal sapphire and designed for direct insertion into process chambers through standard vacuum fittings. Lightpipes can be factory bent, inserted through small holes or vacuum fittings, and can survive harsh temperature and pressure environments. Measurements as low as 30°C (0.7 to 1.65 μm) and 210°C (0.9 μm).|
|Fiber Optics to Lens|For applications with high ambient temperatures or flammable/combustible hazards. The fiber optics allow the electronics to be safely located separate from the measurement area. If mechanical space is limited near the measurement area, then fiber optics can offer more flexible integration and mounting options. Measurements as low as 65°C (0.7 to 1.65 μm) and 270°C (0.9 μm).|
|Fiber Optics to Lightpipe|Similar to Fiber Optics to Lens, this configuration is also considered for applications with high ambient temperatures or flammable/combustible hazards. The use of a lightpipe is usually in conjunction with a process chamber or reactor. Measurements as low as 60°C (0.7 to 1.65 μm) and 240°C (0.9 μm).|
