# TREK 820 INFINITRON®

High impedance voltmeter with contacting or non-contacting modes to acquire precision surface voltage measurements.

The ±2 kV Trek® 820 Infinitron® voltmeter may be used in either contacting or non-contacting mode to acquire precision surface voltage measurements. It is especially beneficial when used with applications that demand infinitely high loading impedance levels far beyond the reach of currently available high impedance voltmeter instruments. The Trek 820 comes with a guarantee of virtually no modification of the object being measured. This allows the instrument to indicate, with high precision, the voltage level of both conductive and insulative objects and surfaces.

# PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS
