# MIKRON M390

High temperature blackbody calibration source with temperature range of 300 to 3000°C

The Mikron® M390 ultra-fast high temperature blackbody calibrator is without parallel in its capability to produce very high temperature, high emissivity targets, and at the same time stabilize at the required temperature within a few minutes. The cavity is a graphite tube target with a 25 mm (1") diameter with an effective emissivity of 1.0 from 0.65 to 1.8 μm. Target temperature is sensed by a rapid response Impac® infrared thermometer which drives a PID controller to regulate the target temperature precisely to the desired value.

# MIKRON M390

# OVERVIEW

Blackbody calibration sources are infrared radiators used for calibrating and verifying the output signals of infrared thermometers (pyrometers), thermal imaging systems, heat flux measurement systems, or spectrographic analysis systems. Advanced Energy supplies a unique selection of very precise calibration sources that are traceable to national standards. Quotations for custom designs and variations are available upon request.

Mikron calibration sources have long been the gold standard to calibrate the instruments that keep your operations up and running. These blackbodies are superior because of the emissivity values, homogeneous emission areas, and a wide range of different sized apertures to adapt to the desired target area. In addition, fast heat-up times and high temperature stability are guaranteed. The quality of our calibration sources is guaranteed by tests, burn-in times, and radiometric calibrations. On most models, a certificate is provided to document the traceability to the international temperature scale ITS90 and NIST.

The source and the controller are housed in separate modules, which allow the source to be positioned in a location remote from the controller such as in an environmental test chamber, or to be used in tests which involve long path lengths. Each module is fitted with a carrying handle and can be comfortably carried to manufacturing plant or field research locations.
