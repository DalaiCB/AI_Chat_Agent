# OUTPUT VOLTAGE ADJUSTMENT OF THE LDO10C SERIES

The ultra-wide output voltage trim range offers major advantages to users who select the LDO10C series. It is no longer necessary to purchase a variety of modules in order to cover different output voltages. The output voltage can be trimmed in a range of 0.59 - 5.1 Vdc. When the LDO10C converter leaves the factory, the output has been adjusted to the default voltage of 0.59 V.

Notes:

1. Measured as per recommended system capacitance. See Application Note 186.
2. di/dt = 10 A/μs, Vin = Nom, Tc = 25 °C, load change = 0.50 lo to full lo and full lo to 0.50.
3. External input fusing is recommended.
4. Additional part numbers may be available with different output voltages.
5. Airflow dependent, 100 LFM minimum required.
6. No capacitors needed for ripple current stability.
7. No capacitors needed for stability.
8. NOTICE: the input voltage must be greater than the programmed output voltage. The max duty cycle is 95%. These non-isolated dc-dc modules are buck converters.
