# EVERGREENTM VENTOTM FCM30K

30,000 W Bulk Front End

Advanced Energy’s FCM30K series provides for a very wide range of AC-DC embedded power requirement. Featuring high build quality with robust screw terminals, long life, and typical full-load efficiency of greater than 95.5%, these units are ideal for use in industrial and medical applications. They are backed by a comprehensive set of industrial and medical safety approvals and certificates. Variable-speed "smart fans" draw on software controls developed by Advanced Energy to match fan speed to the unit’s cooling requirement and load current. Slowing the fan not only saves power but also reduces wear, thus extending its life.

# PSM FEATURES

Power System Manager (PSM) is a pluggable type AEI’s PMC-Lite assembly that controls and oversees the PMI and Modules operations. FCM30K shelf can operate standalone without the need of PSM; provided, end customer ensures all module output V/I operating conditions are set through Modbus or I/O signals.

Power Metering (Optional)

The power-metering interface is able to report via UART communication through PSM the following electrical input information:

|Parameter|Load|Accuracy|
|---|---|---|
|AC input voltage|0 - 100%|±1%|
| |&lt;15%|±0.5 A|
|AC input current|15% - 30%|±2%|
| |&gt;30% - 100%|±1%|
| |&lt;10%|±25 W|
|AC input active power|10% - 20%|±5%|
