# BOILERSPECTION SD

Infrared camera system for continuous temperature measurement and monitoring in boilers and furnaces from 500 to 1600°C (932 to 2912°F).

The BoilerSpection™ SD thermal imaging system provides continuous, real-time, through-flame imaging plus is resilient and robust enough to withstand the harshest conditions. Plant operators need a view inside the boiler, furnace or kiln to increase efficiency, improve emissions, and lower operating costs. BoilerSpection includes state-of-the-art optics, infrared cameras, an auto-retraction device, networking components, and software to control the entire system remotely. The LumaSpec RT software is a powerful tool for analysis and historical trending, outputs to automation and DCS, along with a real-time web server to broadcast images over the plant’s network.

# PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS

- Capture lost boiler capacity by reducing unnecessary cleanings
- Increase efficiency by improving heat transfer with precise knowledge of slag and ash buildup
- Lower maintenance costs by optimizing cleaning and identifying large deposits (clinkers) before they cause damage to boiler tubes
- Optimize fuel-switching by directly and accurately measuring ash rate and uniformity as fuel changes
- Manage combustion by tracking uniformity of ash deposits

# SYSTEM INSTALLATION

The BoilerSpection system can be installed and commissioned either while the boiler is operating or during an outage. The cameras system mounts to the furnace wall via a mounting plate. Advanced Energy offers a choice of weld-on or bolt-on mounting plates. Exact dimensions can be customized by request.

The standard BoilerSpection system has the following requirements:

- Facility connections
- Ports with a 2” (50 mm) clearance
- Less than 330’ (100 m) distance between cameras and the field switch cabinet
- Less than 820’ (250 m) distance from field switch cabinet and control room
- Instrument grade air

# BOILERSPECTION MB

Mobile infrared camera for clear inspection of boiler tubes and furnace walls in temperatures between 500 to 1600°C (932 to 2912°F).

The BoilerSpection™ MB thermal imaging system uses a special mid-wave infrared detector, allowing operators to better see through flames in a boiler, furnace, kiln, or incinerator. This unique feature means BoilerSpection MB provides the clearest and most stable through-flame images. With a real-time infrared inspection, plant operators can quickly and accurately identify process abnormalities, allowing for more optimal combustion and heat transfer.

Operators can then direct cleaning operations, regulate flow of fuel and air, reduce emissions, reduce fuel consumption, speed up boiler start up, and improve safety.

Superheat pendants in 700MW power boiler burning PRB coal

BoilerSpection MB is a completely digital and IP addressable camera system that utilizes standard connections for viewing and recording real-time images. It also includes a standard video (BNC) output for use with legacy video equipment.

PRODUCT BENEFITS

- Mobile or semi-permanent through-flame imaging inside power boilers, furnaces and incinerators
- Pinpoint problems before they cause outages
- Inspect buildup of ash/slag on boiler tubes
- Diagnose burner flame conditions
- Measure temperature across entire image
- Record and analyze data to optimize combustion processes
- Compatible with BoilerSpection SD continuous monitoring solution
