# MIKRON M310-HT

Portable, compact low temperature blackbody calibration source with a large surface area. Ambient +5 to 450°C (+9 to 842°F).

The Mikron® M310-HT is a portable blackbody calibration source utilizing a digital indicating temperature controller that may be set to any temperature between ambient 5 to 450°C (9 to 842°F). A precision platinum RTD temperature sensor is embedded in the blackbody emitter, providing high accuracy and repeatability. The temperature controller uses the industry standard PID algorithms to control the emitter temperature to within 0.3°C of the set points. The blackbody emitter mechanism uses a resistive heating device that provides a long life, short stabilization times, and stable temperature control.

# MIKRON M310HT

# OVERVIEW

Blackbody calibration sources are infrared radiators used for calibrating and verifying the output signals of infrared thermometers (pyrometers), thermal imaging systems, heat flux measurement systems, or spectrographic analysis systems. Advanced Energy supplies a unique selection of very precise calibration sources that are traceable to national standards. Quotations for custom designs and variations are available upon request.

Mikron calibration sources have long been the gold standard to calibrate the instruments that keep your operations up and running. These blackbodies are superior because of the emissivity values, homogeneous emission areas, and a wide range of different sized apertures to adapt to the desired target area. In addition, fast heat-up times and high temperature stability are guaranteed. The quality of our calibration sources is guaranteed by tests, burn-in times, and radiometric calibrations. On most models, a certificate is provided to document the traceability to the international temperature scale ITS90 and NIST.
