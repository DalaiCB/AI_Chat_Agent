# IMPAC ISR 12-LO AND 16291

IGAR 12-LO

Digital 2-color pyrometer with fiber optics for temperature measurement on metals, ceramics, graphite, etc. between 300 and 3300°C.

The Impac® ISR 12-LO and IGAR 12-LO are digital, highly accurate 2-color infrared thermometers with fiber optics for non-contact temperature measurement. The pyrometers measure using the 2-color principle in which two adjacent wavelengths are used to calculate the temperature and can be switched to 1-color mode and used like a conventional pyrometer. The metal mode allows for measurements of metals and alloys with unknown K-factor (emissivity slope). Optical head and fiber can be used in very high ambient temperatures up to 250°C without cooling and are unaffected by electromagnetical interferences.

# FIBER OPTICS

The radiation, coming in through the optical head, is transported via the lens system into the mono glass fiber with flexible stainless steel protection tube where it is transmitted along to the converter. As the optical head contains only the lens system and the sensor and the electronics are located in the converter box, fiber and optical head can withstand ambient temperatures up to 250°C without cooling. Depending on the measuring range 2 different fibers are used. They are marked red or blue.

# OPTICAL HEAD

Depending on the application the instrument will be delivered with a small or a large optical head. The selection of the optical head depends not only on its size but also on the required spot size (size of the measuring object) and the measuring distance.

# Optical Head I

With the very small dimensions the optical head I is suited for use in confined spaces. The optics is adjusted to one of the measuring distances mentioned in the table. The mentioned spot size will be achieved in exactly this distance (other distances on request).

# Optical Head II

The optics II is bigger, but smaller spot sizes can be achieved. Two designs are available, fixed adjusted or focusable.

Similar to optics I, the fixed adjusted type is adjusted to one of the measuring distances mentioned in the table (other distances on request).

The focusable type is available for 6 different distance ranges. Each measuring distance can be adjusted within the mentioned limits to achieve the smallest spot size in the required distance.

# IMPAC ISR 12-LO • IGAR 12-LO

# INFRAWIN 5 OVERVIEW

InfraWin is easy-to-use measurement and evaluation software for remote configuration of stationary, digital Impac brand pyrometers.

This software allows the user to remotely adjust and control settings for one or two pyrometers from a single computer. InfraWin also allows the user to simultaneously monitor and control temperatures.

- Display temperature data as color bars and online graphics
- Capture downstream evaluations as tables, graphics, or text files
- Calculate the spot size for different measuring distances
- Features UPP standard (Universal Pyrometer Protocol)

# Pyrometer Settings

An Impac digital pyrometer connected to a PC will be automatically detected by the software. All available parameters are adjustable, including emissivity, response time, maximum value storage, output signal, and sub-range.

Further special functions are adjustable, for example, controllers or TV parameters on instruments available with these functions. Changes are transmitted directly to the pyrometer.

# Measurement with Color Bar

In this window, a temperature value for the upper or lower limit can be adjusted numerically or with the mouse. The acquired minimum and maximum value is indicated as well as the inner temperature of the pyrometer. The emissivity is changeable during the measurement at any time.

# Infrared Calculator

After input of the aperture and the focused spot size per datasheet, the calculation of spot sizes at non-focused distances is possible.

Measurement with Internal Temperature of radiation temperature and internal instrument temperature. Parameters can be changed during the measurement.

I/O Module allows users to trigger measurement externally and gives a potential free output contact.
