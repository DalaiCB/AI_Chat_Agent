# ThermAsset®2

Fiber Optic Winding Hot Spot Temperature Monitor and Temperature Controller for Power Transformers

More Control

The ThermAsset ® 2 controller is designed to measure transformer winding hot spots in real time and activate control of the cooling system. This allows for optimum operation of the transformer at safe load capacity during overload conditions.

Now available for use with our new Quality Probes™ and your choice of 2, 4, 6 or 8 measurement channels, the ThermAsset2 offers reliable and proven features of hot spot winding monitoring and control at a cost-effective price. It is based on our Luxtron WTS-22 Winding Temperature Monitor, which is considered world-wide as the industry standard for fiber optic power transformer winding temperature monitoring and control.

Power transformers often take the brunt of an overload condition and are the most likely to be damaged without proper control and protection. The drift-free, calibration-free nature inherent in our patented Fluoroptic® technology makes the ThermAsset2 ideally suited for use in transformers as a reliable and cost-effective means of protection for these valuable assets. The ThermAsset2 is designed for small, medium and large power transformers.

The ThermAsset2 offers the additional capability of controlling the cooling system (fans and pumps) and activating protective trips with real-time measurements originating at the transformer winding. Unlike conventional top oil temperature measurements, which can lag hours behind in response time, fiber optics provide direct, real-time accurate measurements of the transformer winding suitable for dynamic load control or as a valuable input to calibrate thermal models.

The ThermAsset2 comes with six Form-C programmable relays and meets 3000V surge protection requirements (IEEE C37.90.1-1989). The ThermAsset2 system, including either Quality or Rugged probes, provides the most cost-effective comprehensive system in the market for winding hot spot measurements and protection and control of transformer auxiliary systems. With more than 25 years of fiber optic experience, LumaSense temperature measurement systems are considered the industry leader in fiber optic measurements. This experience is incorporated into the design of the ThermAsset2.
