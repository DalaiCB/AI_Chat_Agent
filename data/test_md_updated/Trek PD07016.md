# TREK PD07016

High voltage power amplifier featuring an all-solid-state design for wide bandwidth, high slew rate, and low-noise operation for load current monitoring.

The Trek® PD07016 is a DC-stable, high voltage power amplifier that is configured as noninverting with a fixed gain of 1000 V/V and is protected against over-voltage and over-current conditions that may be generated by active loads or by output short circuits to ground. Precision voltage and current monitors provide low-voltage representations of the high voltage output and load current for monitoring purposes or for use as feedback signals in a closed-loop system. The 4-quadrant, active output stage sinks or sources current to reactive or resistive loads throughout the output voltage range. This is essential to achieve the accurate output response and high slew rates demanded by reactive loads.
