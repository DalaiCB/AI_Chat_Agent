Waveform at the Plasma (Actual)

Waveform at the Generator's Output

A patented boost circuit on the leading edge of the sputtering waveform accelerates delivery of power to the process compared to a sine wave generator. The reverse portion of the waveform maximizes control, allowing more definitive charge clearing during the reverse cycle.

Dual-Magnetron Sputtering of Reactive Materials and "Bi-Material Co-Sputtering"

Control power delivery to each magnetron independently for increased deposition rates and target utilization.
