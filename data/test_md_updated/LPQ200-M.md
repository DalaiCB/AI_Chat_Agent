# ARTESYN LPQ200-M SERIES

200 Watts

Advanced Energy’s Artesyn LPQ200-M series of open-frame AC-DC power supplies comprises two quad output models, one offering 3.3 V, 5 V, 12 V, and -12 V outputs, the other offering 5 V, 12 V, 24 V, and -12 V. Both models feature medical safety approvals and accept a universal input of 90—264 Vac or 120—300 Vdc. These compact switch-mode power supplies feature main output overvoltage protection and remote sense, with short-circuit protection on all outputs. Additional facilities include thermal overload protection and remote indication of power failure. LPQ200-M series power supplies provide 100 watts of output power with free air convection cooling and 200 watts with 30 CFM of forced air. Less than 1U high, they are suitable for a wide range of uses, including non-patient contact and non-patient critical medical applications.
