# Megohmmeter

- Measure to 200 GΩ in 6 Selectable Ranges
- Measurement Accuracy ± 5%
- 50, 100, 250, 500 VDC Test Voltages
- 3½ Digit Display
- Rugged Weather Tight Case
- Versatile Test Probes
- Front panel LED to indicate the presence of voltage

The Model R1M-A series portable megohmmeter is designed to measure very high values of insulation resistance. The instrument has six resistance ranges from 1 MΩ full scale to 100 GΩ full scale, with 100% overrange capability. Four test voltages of 50, 100, 250, and 500 VDC are provided (50 V maximum to be used with resistances less than 1 MΩ). Resistance readings are displayed on a 3½ digit LCD display with 0.5 inch character height.

The R1M-A series is packaged in a rugged weather tight case, designed to withstand the wear and tear of industrial and military applications, and has a gasketed lid. An internal compartment is provided to store the line cord and a set of test cables.

# Operation

The user selects a resistance range and test voltage. Depressing a momentary pushbutton switch connects the selected test voltage and starts the gigaohmmeter operation. For safety reasons, the pushbutton must be held in to take a reading. A front panel LED turns ON to indicate the presence of voltage at the terminals. When the pushbutton is released, the test voltage is shorted out to prevent accidental injury to the operator.

Controls and Input Connections

An ON/OFF toggle switch controls power supplied through a line cord from a standard 120 VAC, 60 Hz power receptacle. A six-position rotary switch selects the resistance range, and a four-position rotary switch selects the test voltage. A pushbutton switch is depressed to take resistance measurements.

Four input terminals are provided. The TEST terminal is a recessed terminal, which outputs up to 500 VDC, for use with a shrouded banana-plug test lead. The other three terminals, SIG (signal), GUARD, and GND (ground), are 5-way binding posts.
