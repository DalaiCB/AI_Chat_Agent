# ULTRAVOLT 10HVA – 20HVA SERIES

# PRECISION HIGH VOLTAGE AMPLIFIER

The UltraVolt® 10HVA – 20HVA series of DC-to-DC high voltage power supplies operates a precision filter / divider and linear HV switch to produce a high voltage amplifier (HVA). These modules provide a high-resolution, high voltage DC to full scale waveform capability greater than 500 Hz output. 10 / 15 / 20 kV HVA modules are optimized for bias applications while providing excellent line regulation, load regulation, dynamic response, and stability. The HVA series can both source and sink current operating linearly through 0 V with low ripple and noise over the entire output range.

# PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS

- Bipolar models available at 0 to 10 kV, 15 kV, 20 kV
- Unipolar models available at 0 to 15 kV and 20 kV
- Operates in DC, reversible, and amplifier modes
- Fast slew rate and high bandwidth at an excellent value
- Can both source and sink current
- PPM level line & load regulation
