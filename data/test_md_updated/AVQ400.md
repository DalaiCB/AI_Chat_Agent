# ARTESYN AVQ400 SERIES

396 Watts

Advanced Energy's Artesyn AVQ400 series quarter-brick DATA SHEET isolated DC-DC converter is designed specifically to provide a regulated low noise 12 Vdc output for feeding downstream non-isolated point-of-load (POL) converters in systems with distributed power architectures (DPA). The converter has a wide 2:1 input range of 36 to 75 Vdc and is designed primarily for use with standard 48 V telecommunications equipment supplies. Rated at 396 watts, it can deliver up to 33 amps and accommodates a wide ambient operating temperature range of -40 to 85˚C.
