# HITEK POWER XRG70

X-RAY POWER SUPPLY MODULES

HITEKPOWER

Specifically developed for high-performance, compact x-ray applications, the HiTek Power® XRG70 series is exceptionally small and reliable. It offers superior high-voltage stability, stress control, and packaging. This series includes a variety of models from 25 to 70 kV, and is based on the grounded filament series of products for grounded cathode applications. The filament is automatically controlled by the integral beam current loop-control and the power stage utilizes a current-fed resonant push-pull converter to provide high efficiency while ensuring reliable operation.

# PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS

- 72 W high-voltage output max
- 20 W grounded filament
- Exceptionally compact
- Local and remote operation
- Safety interlock
- High accuracy and stability

# TYPICAL APPLICATIONS

X-ray fluorescence (XRF)
