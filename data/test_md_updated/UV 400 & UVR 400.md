# UV 400 AND UVR 400

True wafer surface temperature and reflectance instrumentation for GaN-based epitaxy.

The UV 400 and UVR 400 systems are the next generation of temperature sensors developed specifically for GaN-based MOCVD epitaxy processes. These pyrometers allow direct measurement of the wafer surface temperature instead of the traditional susceptor/pocket temperature.

# PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS

- Improved yield through accurate true wafer temperature measurement
- Measure temperature directly on the GaN layer using UV wavelength instrumentation

- Capture real-time reflectance measurement using a fast pulsing light source
- Prevent residue temperature oscillation as seen in NIR emissivity-compensated pyrometers
- Prevent data skew due to delayed sampling (no shutter on and off)
- Minimize noise in measurement using true photocounting instrumentation

# UV 400 • UVR 400

# OVERVIEW

Direct measurement allows for more accurate control of the wafer temperature leading to an improved yield. These systems are setting a new standard for LED production processes with results showing reliable correlation between process temperature and final product wavelength.

The UVR 400 includes an additional reflectometer at 635 nm with 0.5 kHz measurement speed. This enables measurement of deposition thickness. The U400 predecessor, the TR 2100, was the first pyrometer with the integrated reflectometer (in 2001), establishing the industry standard for active emissivity compensation for using 950 nm and fiber optics. Advances in sapphire light-pipe sensors and in-situ blackbody calibration sources provide a complete temperature measurement solution.

# OPTICS

The pyrometer is equipped with the optics listed below. The optics are focused for a specific distance, which means that at that distance the optics have their smallest possible spot size in relation to the measuring distance. If the distance from the object being measured is increased or decreased, the spot size changes.

|Aperture D/mm|Quartz window thickness = 10 mm|Distance a [mm]|Spot diameter M [mm]|
|---|---|---|---|
|37 (G5)|with|74|9.8|
|37 (G5)|without|77|10.2|

MEASUREMENT OF THE GAN LAYER

GaN material emits below 400 nm in the ultraviolet spectrum and improvements in short wavelength detectors allow for measurement of the epitaxial layer temperatures.

Unlike NIR measurement, UV measurement only measures the GaN layer. Near 400 nm, a relatively thin GaN layer becomes opaque and the pyrometer does not see through the wafer.

This results in a direct measurement of the wafer surface!

|Sapphire Wafer| | |

# INFRAWIN 5 OVERVIEW

InfraWin is easy-to-use measurement and evaluation software for remote configuration of stationary, digital IMPAC® pyrometers.

This software allows the user to remotely adjust and control settings for one or two pyrometers from a single computer. InfraWin also allows the user to simultaneously monitor and control temperatures.

- Display temperature data as color bars and online graphics
- Capture downstream evaluations as tables, graphics, or text files
- Calculate the spot size for different measuring distances
- Features UPP standard (Universal Pyrometer Protocol)

# Pyrometer Settings

An IMPAC digital pyrometer connected to a PC will be automatically detected by the software. All available parameters are adjustable, including emissivity, response time, maximum value storage, output signal, and sub-range.

Further special functions are adjustable, for example, controllers or TV parameters on instruments available with these functions. Changes are transmitted directly to the pyrometer.

# Measurement with Color Bar

In this window, a temperature value for the upper or lower limit can be adjusted numerically or with the mouse. The acquired minimum and maximum value is indicated as well as the inner temperature of the pyrometer. The emissivity is changeable during the measurement at any time.

# Infrared Calculator

After input of the aperture and the focused spot size per datasheet, the calculation of spot sizes at non-focused distances is possible.

# Measurement with Internal Temperature

Measurement with Internal Temperature of radiation temperature and internal instrument temperature. Parameters can be changed during the measurement.

I/O Module allows users to trigger measurement externally and gives a potential free output contact.
