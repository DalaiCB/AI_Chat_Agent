# Apex® RF Generators and Power-Delivery Systems

The versatile Apex® family of RF generators provides remarkably high power density and power-delivery consistency. Sophisticated RF conversion technology not only offers enhanced product and process reliability but also increases cost effectiveness by eliminating the need for front-end, DC-to-DC conversion components. Exceptionally fast and sensitive arc-handling technology also increases yield and lowers CoO. For superb performance in plasma-based, thin-film processes for semiconductor, flat panel display, or data storage manufacturing, the Apex platform is the ideal choice. With its unique, modular design—in a package so trim it can be mounted directly on the chamber—the Apex platform is also highly customizable to suit your specific process needs.

# Benefits

- Higher power density
- Improved process flexibility
- Increased yield
- Lower CoO
- Simplified process tool integration
- Flexible communications

# Innovative RF Technology

Leveraging truly innovative RF conversion technology, the Advanced Energy® (AE) Apex family of RF generators provides higher power density, greater delivered power repeatability, increased reliability, and superior return on investment (ROI) compared to conventional RF generators. The Apex platform includes rack-mountable 1.5 to 10 kW models. A comprehensive set of configurable features allows you to customize the Apex platform to suit your specific process needs. The result is a completely customized unit—without lengthy custom-generator lead times.

# Higher Power Density

The innovative Apex platform’s unique technology eliminates typical front-end conversion components—increasing power density to give you more power, dollar for dollar.

# Flexible Communications

Regulatory Compliant

# Improved Process Flexibility

All Apex models use control loops to ensure stable plasma operation over a broad process regime. In addition, optional, high-repetition-rate pulsing enhances your ability to develop advanced processes.

# Increased Yield; Lower CoO

As process geometries shrink, RF arcing is a growing source of yield loss and tool damage. The exceptional speed and sensitivity of AE’s arc management technology both minimizes potential damage and preserves plasma ignition to maximize productivity. This technology rapidly detects and extinguishes micro-arcs that conventional approaches often miss. The damage caused by these neglected arcs may go undiscovered until late in the manufacturing process, which increases the dollars wasted on bad devices. Apex generators also eliminate hard RF arc damage to process equipment, lowering CoO by improving tool uptime and throughput.
