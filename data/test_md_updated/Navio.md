# NAVIO DIGITAL MATCHING NETWORK

Improve Throughput, Increase Yield, and Reduce Production Costs

The Navio matching network automatically tunes the complex impedance of a plasma to 50 Ω or your desired impedance. The digital tuning algorithm and stepper motor drive produce a quicker, more accurate, and repeatable response compared to traditional analog tuning methods — for improved throughput, increased yield, and reduced production costs.

The Navio matching network is fast and highly accurate, designed to always tune to the desired impedance point. Its repeatable response minimizes delivered power deviations between matches and run to run—even under varying operating conditions — for an extremely high level of process stability and uniform deposition.

Choose a Standard Model or Configure a Unit That Meets Your System Specifications

Choosing the right matching network has never been easier. With three decades of power expertise, we’ve engineered a cost-effective solution with performance advantages that are sure to satisfy. The Navio matching network features off-the-shelf functionality for those looking for a simple solution. Standard units are optimized for applications that have well understood impedances yet require fast, reliable auto-tuning.

For more sophisticated processes, a generous menu of configuration options are available, including:

- Broad power ranges—1 kW, 3 kW, and 5 kW
- Wide input frequencies—13.56 MHz, 27.12 MHz, 40.68 MHz, and 60 MHz
- Multiple RF input and output connector options
- Multiple tuning ranges

Multiple Tuning Ranges

Figure 1 highlights the pre-defined tuning ranges available for 13.56 MHz Navio matching networks. If necessary, tuning ranges can be adjusted during your development phase; our field service engineers will work with you to pinpoint the range that’s right for your application and quickly reconfigure your unit in the field.

Figure 1. Pre-defined tuning range options for the 13.56 MHz Navio™ matching network. Similar options are available for 27.12 MHz, 40.68 MHz, and 60 MHz models.

Install and Operate with Ease

The Navio matching network can be paired with any RF generator but communicates directly with the Cesar® power supply. Installation is easy, and operation is virtually automatic with no manual configuration required. Microprocessor control through the Virtual Front Panel (VFP) software enables you to monitor and command the system using a personal computer. VFP software also passively monitors many power functions and actively controls tuning parameters, providing intuitive, broad-ranging functionality. It features event monitoring, readbacks, Smith® charting, and password-controlled access.
