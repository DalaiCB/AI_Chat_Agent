# IMPAC HIGHSPEED 740 SERIES

# OVERVIEW

The Impac IGA 740 and IGA 740-LO pyrometers are stationary instruments for non-contact temperature measurement of metallic surfaces, graphite, ceramics, etc. With the extremely fast response time of only 6 μs, they are suitable for use in high-speed applications.

Two types are available: the compact instrument IGA 740 with integrated optics and the IGA 740-LO with fiber and optical head.

The IGA 740 is available with either focusable or macro optics. With the focusable optics, a measuring distance between 450 and 3000 mm can be adjusted to achieve the smallest spot sizes. The macro optics provides, at a fixed distance, a spot size of only 0.7 mm or 1 mm, depending on the temperature range.

The IGA 740-LO uses an optical fiber and an optical head for transmitting the radiation. The fiber and optical head are unaffected by electromagnetic interferences (e.g. induction) and can be used in very high ambient temperatures up to 260°C without cooling.

For easy alignment to the measuring object, the instruments are equipped with an LED targeting light that shows the size of the spot. Alternatively, the IGA 740 can be delivered with a viewfinder.

# OPTICS

Depending on the application, the instrument is available with different optics. The selection mainly depends on the required spot size (size of the measuring object) and the measuring distance. For the Focusable Optics, as well as the Fiber Optical Heads, the measuring distances are measured from the leading edge of the optics. For the Macro Optics, they are measured from the pyrometer’s front edge. Optical fiber and optics are not included in the scope of delivery of the IGA 740-LO and must be ordered separately.
