# TREK 609E-6

High voltage power amplifier for industrial and research applications that features an all solid-state design for a high slew rate, wide bandwidth, and low-noise operation.

The Trek® 609E-6 is a DC-stable, high-voltage power amplifier used in industrial and research applications. The four-quadrant, active output stage sinks or sources current into reactive or resistive loads throughout the output voltage range. This type of output is essential to achieve an accurate output response and high slew rate demanded by a variety of loads such as highly capacitive or reactive loads. It is configured as a non-inverting amplifier, an inverting amplifier or as a differential amplifier. Different input configurations can be wired into the unit.
