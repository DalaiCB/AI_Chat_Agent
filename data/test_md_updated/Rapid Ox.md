# RAPID OX REMOTE PLASMA SOURCE FOR OXYGEN-BASED PROCESSES

The Rapid OX is the perfect RPS for oxygen processes due to its unique user-insertable and removable quartz chamber liner. The liner reduces recombination of oxygen, ensuring effective transportation of reactive species to the process chamber. With 6kW of power, the Rapid OX dissociates oxygen with variable frequency and power control for optimal performance. The removable and replaceable quartz liner reduces downtime and significantly lowers replacement costs when compared to products with full quartz chambers, leading to better tool utilization, reduced particulate matter, and overall lower cost of ownership.

# PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS

- Variable frequency tuning and precise power control enables repeatable, controllable processes
- Highly-reliable chamber design and cooling system improves chamber lifetime and reduces service costs
- High dissociation rate and high-density radical generation for improved process performance
- Thermal management in the chamber ensures long, reliable performance
- Resultant reactive species longer lifetime provides improved photoresist strip rates as compared to anodized chamber walls
- Rapid OX ignites and reaches steady state operation rapidly due to low dynamic pressure overshoot

# TYPICAL APPLICATIONS

- Photoresist ashing
- Wafer pre-clean
- Carbon chamber clean processes
