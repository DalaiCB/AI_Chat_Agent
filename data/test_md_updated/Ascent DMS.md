Optimized bipolar waveform for dual-magnetron sputtering applications

Increased Film Value: Repeatable, Customizable Deposited Films

Create the ideal film density, uniformity, transmission, and resistivity for your application by selecting frequency (500 Hz to 50 kHz), regulation method (voltage, current, or power), and duty cycle (5 to 95%).

Fixed-frequency output stabilizes process conditions by eliminating resonant frequency changes, resulting in excellent repeatability. Low stored energy reduces arc-caused process contamination and film defects.

Easy, Custom Installation Options

Modular and scalable, Ascent DMS accessories enable customized installations from 40 to 240 kW, and provide DC and pulsed-DC outputs from the same industry-standard 19" rack.

Lower Cost Ownership and Increased Productivity

The ability to individually control each magnetron increases target-erosion uniformity, while fixed-frequency output reduces arc energy and target nodule formation. These factors significantly reduce maintenance frequency and lengthen productive manufacturing time. They also decrease the cost of consumables by allowing target utilization of 85% or more.

Lower Upfront Costs

With the ability to control power proportionally to each cathode, Ascent DMS configurations eliminate the need to use multiple power supply types, replacing separate AC, DC, and pulsed-DC units. This significantly reduces equipment, inventory, and training costs, and eases maintenance and support.

Higher Power Levels with Reduced Arc Damage

Low arc energy and excellent arc management enable Ascent DMS configurations to achieve higher power levels without compromising film or process quality. While AC designs typically store 6 mJ/kW, Ascent DMS units store less than 1.0 mJ/kW, enabling successful deposition of even the most arc-prone materials, such as AZO, IGZO, IZO, ITO, and SiO2.

Ascent DMS units control the sputter rate of each cathode individually. This enables more uniform target wear and sputtering in multi-cathode, single chamber systems, compared to AC supplies with fixed 50/50 duty cycles.
