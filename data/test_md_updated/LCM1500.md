# ARTESYN LCM1500 1500 Watts Bulk Front End

Advanced Energy’s Artesyn LCM1500 series provide for a very wide range of AC-DC embedded power requirement. Featuring high build quality with robust screw terminals, long life, and typical full-load efficiency of greater than 89 percent, these units are ideal for use in industrial and medical applications. They are backed by a comprehensive set of industrial and medical safety approvals and certificates. Variable-speed ‘Smart Fans’ draw on software controls developed by Advanced Energy to match fan speed to the unit’s cooling requirement and load current. Slowing the fan not only saves power but also reduces wear, thus extending its life.

Notes:

1. Parts must be completely assembled.
2. Quality controlled dimensions. These dimensions to be included in the mechanical CPK of 1.33
3. Casing parts used must have matching color. In order to ensure color matching of parts, it is required that the raw material that will be processed by the fabricator will come from the same supplier and the sheetmetal fabricator for all matching parts must be the same. To avoid color variations on the same lot delivered, all parts with matching color requirement should be delivered as a set by the fabricator.
4. Sheared edges visible to the customer should have no rust formation. If rust formation is present then a concealing layer of silver ink or some other substitute should be applied on the rusted area.
5. Mounting locations screw penetration depth is 4.6mm max.
6. Recommended screw torque:
- M3.5X0.6P = 6-8kgf-cm
- M4.0X0.7P = 8-10kgf-cm
7. Input: terminal block type. M4 screw torque value of 16kgf-cm using wire gauge 18-10 (13mm centers)
