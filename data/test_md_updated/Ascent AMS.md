# ASCENT AMS

Industry-Leading Arc Management

VoltageMany insulative target materials used in magnetron PVD processes produce up to thousands of arcs per second — a level that requires more than the rudimentary detection and handling that conventional arc management provides. With three key innovations — Arc Management System™ technology, Set Point Compensation™ technology, and Arc-Sync technology — Ascent AMS power supplies enable the use of new target materials, with reduced film and equipment damage, stable throughput, and the ability to synchronize the arc responses of connected units.

# Arc Management System™ Technology

AE’s proprietary AMS technology preserves film quality and repeatability, even under extreme arcing conditions. These enhanced arc handling capabilities enable success with newer materials, such as AZO and IGZO.

- Automatic arc handling eliminates need to adjust arc management parameters.
- Primary arc response quickly removes power from arcs.
- Secondary arc response cools surface and quenches secondary arcs.
- Controlled power recovery minimizes over-shoot and secondary arcs.
- Low stored energy — less than 0.4 mJ per kW—reduces arc impact on the process.
