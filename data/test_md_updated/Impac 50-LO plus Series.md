# IMPAC IS 50-LO PLUS AND IGA 50-LO PLUS SERIES

# OVERVIEW

The instruments are equipped with a fiber and an exchangeable optical head. The fiber and optical head are unaffected by electromagnetical interferences (e.g. induction) and can be used in high ambient temperatures up to 250°C.

Two different types of optical heads for different measuring distances and very small spot sizes are available. A laser targeting light enables the exact alignment onto the measuring object. The very short response time of below 1 ms facilitates the measurement of fastest heating processes. The pyrometers are equipped with a display which shows in measuring mode the current temperature. Additionally, all parameters can be read when they are changed via the integrated keys at the instrument.

The temperature can be displayed and stored via serial interface and the software InfraWin. Parametrizing can also be done via interface or InfraWin.

# OPTICAL HEAD

Depending on the application the instrument will be delivered with a small or a large optical head. The selection of the optical head depends not only on its size but also on the required spot size (size of the measuring object) and the measuring distance.

Optical Head I

With the very small dimensions the optical head I is suited for use in confined spaces. The optics is adjusted to one of the measuring distances mentioned in the table. The mentioned spot size will be achieved in exactly this distance (other distances on request).

Optical Head II

The optics II is bigger, but smaller spot sizes can be achieved. Two designs are available, fixed adjusted or focusable.

Similar to optics I, the fixed adjusted type is adjusted to one of the measuring distances mentioned in the table (other distances on request).

The focusable type is available for 6 different distance ranges. Each measuring distance can be adjusted within the mentioned limits to achieve the smallest spot size in the required distance.

# INFRAWIN 5 OVERVIEW

InfraWin is easy-to-use measurement and evaluation software for remote configuration of stationary, digital Impac brand pyrometers.

This software allows the user to remotely adjust and control settings for one or two pyrometers from a single computer. InfraWin also allows the user to simultaneously monitor and control temperatures.

- Display temperature data as color bars and online graphics
- Capture downstream evaluations as tables, graphics, or text files
- Calculate the spot size for different measuring distances
- Features UPP standard (Universal Pyrometer Protocol)

# Pyrometer Settings

An Impac digital pyrometer connected to a PC will be automatically detected by the software. All available parameters are adjustable, including emissivity, response time, maximum value storage, output signal, and sub-range.

Further special functions are adjustable, for example, controllers or TV parameters on instruments available with these functions. Changes are transmitted directly to the pyrometer.

# Measurement with Color Bar

In this window, a temperature value for the upper or lower limit can be adjusted numerically or with the mouse. The acquired minimum and maximum value is indicated as well as the inner temperature of the pyrometer. The emissivity is changeable during the measurement at any time.

# Infrared Calculator

After input of the aperture and the focused spot size per datasheet, the calculation of spot sizes at non-focused distances is possible.

# Measurement with Internal Temperature

Measurement of radiation temperature and internal instrument temperature. Parameters can be changed during the measurement.

I/O Module allows users to trigger measurement externally and gives a potential free output contact.
