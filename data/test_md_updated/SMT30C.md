OUTPUT VOLTAGE ADJUSTMENT

The ultra-wide output voltage trim range offers major advantages to users who select the SMT30C series. It is no longer necessary to purchase a variety of modules in order to cover different output voltages. The output voltage can be trimmed in a range of 0.9 Vdc to 5.0 Vdc. When the SMT30C series converter leaves the factory the output has been adjusted to the default voltage of 0.9 V.

Notes:

1. Uses external resistor from TRIM to ground. See Application Note 170 for details.
2. Measured with external filter. See Application Note 170 for details.
3. di/dt = 10 A/μs, Vin = Nom, Tc = 25 ºC, load change = 0.50 lo max. to 0.75 lo max, and vice versa.
4. External input fusing recommended.
5. Power up is the time from application of dc input to POWER GOOD high. Remote ON/OFF asserted high to POWER GOOD high.
6. Signal line assumed <3 m in length.
7. This product is only for inclusion by professional installers within other equipment and must not be operated as a stand alone product.
8. See Application Note 170 for operation above 50 ºC.
9. See Application Note 170 for more details.
10. For redundant current sharing applications that use ORing diodes to separate the outputs, please add the suffix ‘-S’ to the part number, e.g. SMT30C-12SADJ-SJ. Please refer to Application Note 170 for further details.
11. NOTICE: Some models do not support all options. Please contact your local Artesyn representative or use the on-line model number search tool at http://www.artesyn.com to find a suitable alternative.
