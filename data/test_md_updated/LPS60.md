# ARTESYN LPS60 SERIES

60 W

Advanced Energy’s Artesyn LPS60 series of open-frame AC-DC power supplies comprises six single output models, offering voltages of 3.3 V, 5 V, 12 V, 15 V, 24 V or 48 V. Each model accepts a universal input of 85 to 264 VAC or 120 to 300 VDC. These compact switch-mode power supplies feature output overvoltage and short-circuit protection, as well as remote sense. LPS60 series power supplies provide 60 watts of output power with free air convection cooling and 80 W with 30 CFM of forced air. They are suitable for a wide variety of applications, including test and measurement, single-board computers, telecommunications, and networking.
