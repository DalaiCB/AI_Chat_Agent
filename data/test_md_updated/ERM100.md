# ARTESYN ERM100 ¼ BRICK SERIES

100 Watt ¼ brick DC/DC converter

# ARTESYN

Advanced Energy’s Artesyn ERM100 series is a new generation of high performance, isolated dc-dc converter modules. The product offers 100W in a small, fully encapsulated package. The input voltage ranges comply with European railway standard EN50155. Reinforced insulation and high EMC immunity qualifies these converters also for many demanding applications in railway and other transportation systems. Advanced circuit topology provides a very high efficiency up to 91.5% which allows ambient temperatures range up to +85°C with derating.
