# MIKRON M300

Medium temperature large blackbody calibration source with high emissivity for calibration independent of the wavelength.

The Mikron® M300 is a high standard, precision blackbody calibration source designed with a unique uniformly heated spherical cavity that achieves a near ideal emissivity of 0.998 or better. The M300 will accurately deliver any temperature between 200 to 1150°C (392 to 2102°F). A convenient microprocessor-based, digital PID controller holds the selected temperature to within 1°C, ensuring high accuracy calibration.

# OVERVIEW

Blackbody calibration sources are infrared radiators used for calibrating and verifying the output signals of infrared thermometers (pyrometers), thermal imaging systems, heat flux measurement systems, or spectrographic analysis systems. Advanced Energy supplies a unique selection of very precise calibration sources that are traceable to national standards. Quotations for custom designs and variations are available upon request.

Superior features of these calibration sources include emissivity values, homogeneous emission areas, and a wide range of different sized apertures to adapt to the desired target area. Additionally, fast heat-up times and high temperature stability are guaranteed. The quality of the calibration sources is ensured through tests, burn-in times, and radiometric calibrations. Most models come with a certificate documenting traceability to the international temperature scale ITS90 and NIST.

# Mikron calibration sources have long been the gold standard to calibrate the instruments that keep your operations up and running. These blackbodies
