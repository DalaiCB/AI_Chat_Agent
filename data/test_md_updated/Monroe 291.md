# MONROE 291

Portable survey instrument for evaluating resistive properties of static control products such as static dissipative packaging, flooring, or work surfaces.

The Monroe 291 is a portable, battery-operated survey instrument for evaluating the resistive properties of static control products such as static dissipative packaging, flooring, or work surfaces over the range of 10^3 to 10^12 ohms or ohms per square. The Monroe 291 uses a parallel electrode configuration conforming to ASTM D-257. It also accepts external electrodes for point-to-point and resistance-to-ground measurements. A test lead is included for resistance-to-ground measurements. Simply place the Monroe 291 directly on the item to be measured. An easy-to-read, color-coded LED decade display quickly and clearly indicates the resistivity or resistance range.

EASY-TO-USE OPERATION

To measure surface resistivity of a flat sample of material simply place the instrument on the material so that these
rails are in contact with the material and press the TEST button. To make surface-to-ground or point-to-point
measurements, make connections to one or both of the banana jacks on the end of the instrument. When a banana
plug is inserted, the corresponding contact rail is disconnected.

High Performance

The Monroe 291 resistivity meter fills the void between lower performance, albeit slightly lower cost and high-end,
more expensive test instruments. This pocket-sized meter has parallel metal contact rails and jacks for connections
to external electrodes or ground. Using a single 9-volt alkaline battery, the unit automatically generates a test voltage
of either 10v or 100v. You place the instrument on a flat surface (2 inches by 25/8 inches or larger) of material to be
tested, press the button, and read the results from the multi-colored LED display. It comes with a carrying case, ground
lead and calibration certificate.

- Measures surface resistivity of flat material samples – contact rails built into base of instrument
- Measures resistance – using external connections to banana jacks
