# OUTPUT VOLTAGE ADJUSTMENT OF THE LDO06C SERIES

The ultra-wide output voltage trim range offers major advantages to users who select the LDO06C series. It is no longer necessary to purchase a variety of modules in order to cover different output voltages. The output voltage can be trimmed in a range of 0.59 - 5.1 Vdc. When the LDO06C converter leaves the factory, the output has been adjusted to the default voltage of 0.59 V.

Notes:

1. Measured as per recommended system capacitance. See Technical Reference Note.

2. di/dt = 10 A/μs, Vin = Nom, Tc = 25 °C, load change = 0.50 lo to full lo and full lo to 0.50.

3. External input fusing is recommended.

4. Additional part numbers may be available with different output voltages.

5. Airflow dependent, 100 LFM minimum required.

6. No capacitors needed for ripple current stability.

7. No capacitors needed for stability.
