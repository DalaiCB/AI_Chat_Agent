# ARTESYN ERM150 ¼ BRICK SERIES

150 Watt ¼ brick DC/DC converter

# ARTESYN

Advanced Energy’s Artesyn ERM150 series is a new generation of high performance, isolated dc-dc converter modules. The product offers 150W in a small, fully encapsulated package. The input voltage ranges comply with European railway standard EN50155. Reinforced insulation and high EMC immunity qualifies these converters also for many demanding applications in railway and other transportation systems.
