# HITEK POWER OL400W SERIES

400 W HIGH VOLTAGE POWER SUPPLIES

The HiTek Power ® OL400W range of single-output high voltage power supplies meets the exacting requirements found in a wide variety of precision systems. The OL400W is also suitable for use in ion implantation, ion and chemical vapor deposition, and general laboratory use. Designed using the latest power switching IGBTs to ensure efficient and reliable operation over the full operating range, the OL400W series gives excellent performance in the most severe electrical environments. The OL400W utilizes air as the primary insulation medium for voltages up to 60 kV, achieving a high packing density for high voltage supplies giving 65 W per l (1 W per in3). The 1U construction (2U for 80 kV units) allows operation at full power when close mounted in a standard equipment rack, giving significant savings in rack space in large systems. Featuring a proprietary Arc Count and Extinguish (ACE) system for managing systems where load arcing is possible, the OL400W series protects both itself and the load from damage that may be caused by excessive arcing while allowing normal operation to continue.
