# ARTESYN ALD15 SERIES 15 Amps

The ALD series of sixteenth-brick isolated DC-DC converters comprises seven single output models offering fully regulated voltages of 1.2 V, 1.5 V, 1.8 V, 2.5 V, 3.3 V, 5.0 V or 12.0 V. The 1.2 V and 1.5 V models can deliver up to 15 amps. These converters have a wide 2:1 input range of 36 to 75 Vdc and are designed primarily for use with standard 48 V telecommunications equipment supplies. Rated at 35 watts, they employ an open-frame construction, offer up to 91% efficiency and accommodate an ambient operating temperature range of -40 to 85˚C. The converters use fixed frequency switching to minimize the need for EMI filtering.
