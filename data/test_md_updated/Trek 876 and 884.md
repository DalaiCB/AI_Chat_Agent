# TREK 876 AND TREK 884

Electrostatic voltmeters for accurate non-contacting measurements of the electrostatic surface voltage for ESD applications in ionized or non-ionized environments.

The Trek® 876 (±2kV) and Trek 884 (±20kV) hand held electrostatic voltmeters provide accurate, noncontacting measurements of electrostatic surface voltage for ESD applications in either ionized or non-ionized environments. These two voltmeters utilize a measurement technique that overcomes the disadvantage of the typical hand held field-meter by providing surface voltage measurements which are essentially independent of the sensor probe-to-measured surface spacing.

# PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS

- Accurately measures surface voltage at a wide range of spacings
- No need to maintain a fixed spacing
- Chopper stabilized for drift-free operation in ionized environments
- NIST-traceable Certificate of Calibration provided with each unit

# AT A GLANCE

|Measurement Range|Trek 876: 0 to ±2 kVDC Trek 884: 0 to ±20 kVDC|
|---|---|
|Measurement Accuracy|Better than ±5% of full scale over the entire recommended probe-to-surface separation: Trek 876: 5 to 25 mm Trek 884: 30 to 60 mm|

# APPLICATIONS

- Measurement of electrostatic surface charge build up
- Manufacturing processes
- Electronic assembly testing
- Semiconductor material testing
- Dissipative material testing
- Automotive electronics testing
- ESD Auditing and troubleshooting
