# MKP/1750-5 Kelvin Probe

These probes are excellent for making four-wire surface resistance measurements on films and other flat metallic surfaces. The probes are marked indicating the sense pins, ensuring an operator error-free measurement. Each probe has two spring-loaded, replaceable tips that can be easily removed and replaced. Variety of probe tips available. The test leads are 5 feet long and are terminated with a Lemo connector. Pin center to pin center is 0.11 in (0.28 cm).

Cable length: 5 ft

# MCP/1750-5 Kelvin Coaxial Probe

Ideal for precision resistance measurements in tighter spaces. The probe has a spring-loaded center pin for voltage detection, while the outer pin provides the reference current. The probe comes with two pins installed. The pins are replaceable. The test leads are 5 feet long and are terminated with a Lemo connector. Outer pin diameter is 0.06 in (0.15 cm). The inner tip diameter is 0.4 mm.

Cable length: 5 ft

Replaceable Pin Option: P/N MCP-A (2 pins)
