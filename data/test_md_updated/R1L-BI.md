|R1L-BI|The R1L-BI series Ohmmeter/Bonding Tester is a digital micro-ohmmeter designed to measure resistances up to 20 Ω. It may be used in applications such as ground bond tests, motor, transformers, switch, circuit breaker, circuit resistance and other contact and connection resistance tests. The instruments utilize the four-terminal Kelvin technique to eliminate errors caused by the resistance of the connecting cables. Resistance readings are viewed on a 3½ digit display, reading from 1.999 to 199.9.|233i|

The R1L-BI series Ohmmeter/Bonding Tester is a digital micro-ohmmeter designed to measure resistances up to 20 Ω. It may be used in applications such as ground bond tests, motor, transformers, switch, circuit breaker, circuit resistance and other contact and connection resistance tests. The instruments utilize the four-terminal Kelvin technique to eliminate errors caused by the resistance of the connecting cables. Resistance readings are viewed on a 3½ digit display, reading from 1.999 to 199.9.

Front panel controls are simply a POWER ON-OFF switch and a rotary 5 range selector switch. Measurement connections are made via four front panel low thermal banana jacks.

Both instruments are battery operated and recharged from line power. The BIR model is more suitable for portable “rugged” applications while the BI model is suitable mainly for “in plant” environments.
