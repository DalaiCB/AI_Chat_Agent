# WAVECAPTURE FBGA OVERVIEW

Advanced Energy's WaveCapture Fiber Bragg Grating Analyzer (FBGA) is an integrated spectral engine that serves as the heart of precise, fast, and reliable FBG interrogator systems. The FBG Analyzer employs a proprietary optical design that features high-efficiency dispersive optics, an ultrasensitive detector array, and innovative numerical algorithms to provide high speed, high-resolution spectral measurements in challenging environments. The figure below shows an FBG analyzer integrated into an FBG sensing system. A broadband light source illuminates an optical fiber which features an array of “N” fiber Bragg grating sensors. The FBG array reflects “N” spectral bands of light back down the fiber, where an optical circulator directs the light to the FBG Analyzer. Inside the analyzer, the light is dispersed and the diffracted spectrum is measured by a detector array. Numerical algorithms are used to extract each “Bragg wavelengths" from the raw data, which are sent to the host and converted to temperature, strain, acceleration, or other measured parameter. Both raw and processed data are available to the host.

# SOFTWARE

# WaveCapture Sense 20/20

The WaveCapture™ Sense 20/20 software is a Windows-based program for interfacing with WaveCapture FBG analyzers and systems via USB, RS232, or Ethernet. The software is designed to run on Windows 7 and 10 operating systems. The software provides the following features:

- Setup acquisition mode and parameters
- Acquire spectrum and display into multiple overlays
- Post-process spectrum data such as peak search, background subtraction, spectrum smooth and baseline correction, save and load spectrum data
- Record and replay spectrum data in the fast acquisition mode
- Track the wavelength shift of the selected peaks
- Control SLED light source
- Control optical switch and GPIO output

# WaveCapture Sense 20/20 SDK

WaveCapture Sense 20/20 software development kit (SDK) provides the interface for software developers to access the WaveCapture FBG Analyzer spectrometers. The Dynamic Link Library (DLL) in the SDK can be used under different programming environments, including C, C++, Visual Basic, and LabVIEW. The SDK provides a set of functions that allow users to configure and control the FBG Analyzer spectrometer as well as acquire and post-process the spectrum data.
