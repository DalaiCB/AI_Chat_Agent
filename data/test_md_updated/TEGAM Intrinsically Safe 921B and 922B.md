TRUST is an essential feature in any measurement tool and TEGAM’s new 900 Series thermometers are instruments you can rely on every day with confidence. The 921B and 922B are certified to UL, ATEX and IECEx standards. These new models are the most accurate thermometers ever offered by TEGAM to meet the increasing demands of potentially hazardous environments found in Petro Chemical Plants, Fueling Stations, Aircraft Maintenance, Custody Transfer, Semiconductor, Pharmaceutical and Food Facilities where process temperature measurement is critical. Superior instrument accuracy, combined with the “Probe Offset” feature to zero out probe errors, makes their “system” accuracy unmatched in the industry.

The intrinsically safe single channel Model 921B and dual channel 922B boast 2000–hour battery life using three off-the-shelf AA batteries to provide convenient, dependable, uninterrupted, low-cost portable measurement capability without expensive batteries, AC adapters or chargers.

Real-time statistical data increases user productivity, process efficiency and product quality. Displayed on-demand, MIN, MAX, AVG, RANGE and STDEV (standard deviation) provide critical process information and diagnostics that allow the user to analyze manufacturing processes on the fly and make immediate adjustments for maximum efficiency and quality.

Safety is the top priority in potentially hazardous environments. The low energy TEGAM intrinsically Safe 921B and 922B will guard against ignition when used in environments where flammable liquids, gases, vapors and dust are present. TEGAM also offers a line of intrinsically safe probes for use with the 921B/922B.

Like all TEGAM products, the 900 Series thermometers are designed, assembled and tested in the United States. TEGAM backs this durable instrument with a standard 3–year warranty to assure you that your investment is sound.

For over 30 years, TEGAM has been building handheld thermometers for challenging applications. TEGAM’s 900 Series extends that experience into new thermometers tasked with producing reliable thermocouple measurements in all types of environments. They are designed to be durable and easy to use, with advanced features that outmatch your challenges.

When the Measurement Matters, Be Certain with TEGAM.
