# TREK 156A

Charged plate monitor for evaluating the performance of air ionizers used to neutralize static charges.

The Trek® 156A tests the efficiency of an ionizer’s ion production by timing how long it takes air ions produced to discharge a floating plate that has been pre-charged to either a positive or negative value. The Trek 156A also tests the balance between positive and negative air ions by measuring the offset voltage generated on a floating plate due to an imbalance of positive and negative air ions impinging on the plate from the ionizer.

# PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS

- Customizable measurement capacitance provides assurance that ESD process needs are met in manufacturing and that there is compliance to ANSI/ESD-STM3.1 and IEC 61340-5-1.
- Extremely low offset and drift ensures high accuracy, making it ideal for applications requiring critical ion balance such as GMR and TMR manufacturing areas
- Compact and lightweight, for easy portability within a facility
- NIST-traceable Certificate of Calibration provided with each unit
