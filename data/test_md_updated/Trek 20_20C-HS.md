# TREK 20/20C-HS

High speed, high voltage power amplifier with an all-solid-state design for high slew rate, wide bandwidth, and low-noise operation for industrial and research applications. The Trek® 20/20C-HS is a DC-stable, high-speed, high voltage power amplifier used in industrial and research applications. It features an all-solid-state design for high slew rate, wide bandwidth, and low-noise operation. The four-quadrant, active output stage sinks or sources current into reactive or resistive loads throughout the output voltage range. This type of output is essential to achieve an accurate output response and high slew rate demanded by a variety of loads such as highly capacitive or reactive loads. It is configured as a non-inverting amplifier.

# TREK 20/20C-HS HIGH VOLTAGE POWER AMPLIFIER

# TECHNICAL DATA

|Environmental Specifications| |
|---|---|
|Temperature|0 to 40°C (32 to 104°F)|
|Relative Humidity|Up to 85%, non-condensing|
|Altitude|Up to 2000 meters (6561.68 ft)|

# Features

|High Voltage On/Off|Local: Individual push-button switches Remote: TTL compatible input. TTL high (or open) turns off high voltage output. TTL low turns on high voltage output.|
|---|---|
|Dynamic Adjustment|Graduated one-turn panel potentiometer is used to optimize the AC response for various load parameters|
|Current Limit/Trip|Switch selectable for either limit or trip. Graduated one-turn potentiometer is used to adjust limit or trip level from 0 to 100% peak current. There is one LED indicator and one BNC connector|
|Trip Status Indicator and Connector|An indicator will illuminate and a BNC will provide a TTL low when the high-voltage is disabled due to the output current exceeding the current trip level, the detection of a high-voltage power supply fault, removal of one of the panels, or if the 20/20C-HS is out of regulation for greater than 500 ms.|
|Out of Regulation Status|Illuminates and a TTL low is provided when unit fails to produce required HV output such as during a current limit|
