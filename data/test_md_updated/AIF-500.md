# ARTESYN AIF500-ACDC SERIES

KwPutVARTESYN 504 W ACDC Converter HVDC

Advanced Energy's Artesyn AIF500 family of wide range AC input, high efficiency and standard form factor full brick is an enormously flexible product with an extensive feature set. The low-profile unit which is designed specifically for contact-cooled designs is ideally suited to many different applications. Although it has been designed very much with remote-radio-head RF power supply requirements in mind for 5G telecommunication applications, they are equally at home in industrial applications. The unit features an internal inrush limiting function that is matched to the hold-up function of the module which makes designing applications much easier for the user.
