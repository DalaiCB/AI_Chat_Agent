# ARTESYN TLP150 MEDICAL SERIES Single Output

Advanced Energy's Artesyn TLP150 series of open-frame AC-DC power supplies comprises two single output models, offering a main voltage of 12 V or 24 V. Each model also provides 12 V fan and 5 V standby outputs. Both models feature medical safety approvals and accept a universal input of 85 to 264 VAC. Comprehensive overcurrent, overvoltage, and overtemperature protection is provided as standard. Additional features include main output remote sense, active current sharing, and integrated control and monitoring facilities. TLP150-M series power supplies provide 100 W of output power with free air convection cooling and 150 W with 200 LFM of forced air. Less than 1U high, they are ideal for systems that implement distributed power architectures (DPA) and point-of-load (POL) schemes, as well as for powering electromechanical devices and non-patient contact and non-patient critical medical applications.

# ORDERING INFORMATION

|Output Voltage|Min Output Current|Max Output Current (Max free air)|Max Output Current (Max forced air)|Ripple|Total Regulation|Model Numbers|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|12 V|0 A|8.4 A|12.5 A|120 mV|± 3.0%|TLP150N-99S12J|
|24 V|0 A|4.2 A|6.3 A|240 mV|± 3.0%|TLP150N-99S24J|

Notes:

1. Free air convection. Maximum continuous output power not to exceed 100 W. Refer to Figure 1 for the derating curve.
2. 200 LFM forced air cooling from the ac input side. Maximum continuous output power not to exceed 150 W.
3. Figure is peak-to-peak for room temperature rating. Output noise measurements are made across a 20 MHz bandwidth using a 6 inch twisted pair, terminated with a 10 μF tantalum capacitor and a 0.1 μF ceramic capacitor.
4. CAUTION: Allow a minimum of 1 second after disconnecting line power when making thermal measurements. For optimum reliability no part of the heatsink should exceed 115 °C and no semi-conductor case temperature should exceed 120 °C.
5. No external filtering required during conducted emissions testing but some applications may require additional filtering to achieve system compliance. Compliance with radiated EMI specifications may require mounting in a suitable enclosure.
6. This product is only for inclusion by professional installers within other equipment and must not be operated as a stand-alone product.
7. Three orthogonal axes, random vibration 10 minutes for each axis, 2.4 G.
8. Replace the ‘J’ at the end of the model number with ‘FJ’ when the optional standby output and/or remote ON/OFF control is required e.g. TLP150N-99S12FJ.
9. 12 V (fan) present when main output is present. An optional 5 Vsb (standby) output is available whenever ac input is present, regardless of remote ON/OFF signal status.
10. The ‘J’ suffix indicates that these parts are Pb-free (RoHS 6/6) compliant.
11. NOTICE: Some models do not support all options. Please contact your local Artesyn representative or use the on-line model number search tool at http://www.artesyn.com to find a suitable alternative.
12. Power good signal required 100 mA load on the main output.
13. This product is a Component Power Supply and is only for inclusion by professional installers within other equipment and must not be operated as a standalone product. EMC compliance to appropriate standards must be verified at the system level. This product is for sale to OEMs and System Integrators, including through Distribution Channels. It is not intended for sale to End Users.
