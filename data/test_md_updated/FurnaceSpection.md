# FURNACESPECTION

Infrared camera system for continuous reformer tube monitoring and temperature measurement inside furnaces in refining, glass, and metal processes.

The FurnaceSpection™ thermal imaging system is designed and developed for continuous temperature measurement inside high temperature furnaces in refining, metals, and glass production. FurnaceSpection’s proven technology provides critical insight for failure prevention and asset management. This radiometrically calibrated imager accurately measures the temperature of product, refractory, and heat transfer surfaces inside natural gas fired furnaces. In addition to both standard (SD) and mobile (MB) versions, we can customize a solution to meet your application needs.

# OVERVIEW

FurnaceSpection helps operators monitor and control process temperature uniformity through streaming images and powerful software for analysis and historical trending. Digital and Analog outputs are available to broadcast images of the plant’s local network. For petrochemical reformers, FurnaceSpection is a critical tool to ensure tubes perform optimally for their longest possible life cycle. At a cost of several thousands of dollars per tube and a re-tubing costs in the millions, a significant amount of capital can be lost if tube failure goes unnoticed or tubes are retired too early or too late. In metal annealing applications, FurnaceSpection cameras have allowed users to reduce cycle times while at the same time improving quality and process repeatability.
