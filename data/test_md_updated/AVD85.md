# ARTESYN AVD85 SERIES

85 Watts 1/16 brick DC/DC Converter

Advanced Energy's Artesyn AVD85 series of sixteenth-brick isolated DC-DC converters comprises three single output models offering fully regulated voltages of 3.3 V, 5.0 V or 12 V, rated at 25 A, 17 A and 7 A respectively. All three converters have a wide 2:1 input range of 36 to 75 VDC and are designed primarily for use with standard 48 V telecommunications equipment supplies. Rated at 85 watts, they employ an open-frame construction, offer up to 91% full load efficiency and accommodate an ambient operating temperature range of -40 to 85 OC. A baseplate option is available for enhanced thermal performance. The converters use 250 kHz fixed frequency switching to minimize the need for external EMI filtering.
