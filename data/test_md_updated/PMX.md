# PM Series Microwave Power Calibration System

- Supports Sensors from most major manufacturers from 6 kHz to 50 GHz
- Faster than direct compare method
- Lowest total uncertainty
- National Metrology Institute class thermistor reference standard

The PM Series calibrator simplifies the tedious and complex process of RF power sensor calibration. The goal is to realize consistent, cost-effective, and traceable calibrations. However, the manual approach is very demanding even for the most experienced technician.

A successful calibration involves:

- Setting instruments
- Keeping track of standards
- Computing mismatch (Γ)
- Computing calibration factors (k)
- Computing total uncertainties
- Programming EPROM sensors
- Generating reports and labels

Prices and specifications subject to change without notice.

PMX-909, Rev. FA

TEGAM

The PM Series automates and standardizes this process while providing compatibility with a wide variety of instruments and power sensors.

The PM Series is built upon the 1830A metrology grade RF Power Meter. This is the only RF Power Meter on the market that is compatible with all known types of thermistor sensors including TEGAM, Agilent, Weinschel, Hughes, and Millitech.

A new line of compatible RF power thermistor transfer and reference standards have also been developed that provide flexibility and expandability as your RF calibration needs grow. These standards are based on the same time-proven method used by NIST, PTB, NIM, and other national metrology organizations around the world.

Complete System Integration | PMX Series

TEGAM has condensed their experience with microwave calibration into one convenient and accurate automated system that operates from 6 kHz to 18 or 50 GHz. One turnkey package includes the VNA, signal generator, microwave power standards, workstation, software and accessories required for immediate productivity. The system is configured with instruments from different manufacturers that have been tested and verified by TEGAM to produce an accurate and repeatable calibration. Onsite installation and training are available with each complete system for a fast and trouble-free start up. Due to the wide range of options, the PMX system is quoted on an as requested basis.

Major System Components

PS-Cal® allows for unmatched flexibility when it comes to hardware driver availability. Popular VNA’s like the Agilent/Keysight 8510C and PNA, Anritsu VectorStar and Shockwave, as well as the Rohde & Schwarz ZVA can all be utilized with PS-Cal. The procedures allow for use up to two signal sources per procedure, including function generators. However, this chart consists of the equipment that best meets the specifications of both power and frequency requirements for power sensor calibration.

PS-Cal calibration software delivers both automation and confidence to RF power sensor calibration. Correctly calibrating an RF power sensor is an involved process that requires numerous complex calculations of calibration factor, mismatch correction and uncertainty. PS-Cal is successfully deployed by many organizations who are ISO 17025 accredited. Combined with the fastest calibration available across the greatest number of different sensors, it is the only real option for those who need automation with sensors from multiple manufacturers.
