Note:

1. Other output voltages in the range of 9 V through 36 V are available, contact our sales representative for details.
2. Measured at output connector with 20 MHz bandwidth and 0.1 μF ceramic in parallel with 10 μF electrolytic capacitors.
3. "B" in the model number (SLE36S0903B01) indicates interchangeable blade model.
4. "03" in the model number indicates 2.5 x 5.5 x 9.5 mm straight barrel type connector. Other output connector options are available, please contact our sales representative for details.
