# ARTESYN CPS250-M SERIES 250 W AC-DC Power Supplies

Advanced Energy's Artesyn CPS250-M series of single output open-frame AC-DC power supplies are offered in 12 V, 24 V, or 48 V outputs with +10% trim range. Each power supply comes with a 12 V fan output. All models feature ITE and medical safety approvals and accept a universal input of 90 to 264 VAC. Depending on operating conditions, its 2'' x 4'' x 1.29'' compact and high density design delivers up to 155 W of output power with free air convection cooling and up to 250 W with 300 LFM of forced air. These power supplies are ideal for light industrial systems as well as for medical applications.

# Notes:

OCP can not be adjusted on the fly. Default setting is for 250 W Forced Air.

Unit should be turned off before trimpot adjustment.

OCP does not vary linearly with the trimpot adjustment. It is either Full clockwise (250 W) or Full counter clockwise (155 W).

Thermal Hot Spot Reference - Do not exceed indicated temperature limits to ensure operation is within the component thermal derating limits. Measure the component temperatures using K type thermocouples.

Recommended Mounting Screw - M3.0 (4X) Pan head screw with teeth washer, 6 mm length, 6~8 Kgf-cm Torque.

Unit weight 200 g max

|Thermal Hot Spot Reference|Component|Temperature Limit|
|---|---|---|
| |L2|135 °C|
| |T501|145 °C|
| |Q501|120 °C|
| |C12|95 °C|
