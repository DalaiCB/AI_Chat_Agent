The TEGAM High Power Calibration System is an automated solution for calibrating through path and terminating RF power measurement devices from multiple manufacturers. It includes the signal generation, amplification and filtering necessary to achieve or exceed the devices original specifications with the most accurate high power measurement system available.

The basis for the High Power Calibration System’s unmatched accuracy is an exclusive flow calorimeter designed to provide low uncertainties and convenient traceability. An internationally recognized AC power standard is used to calibrate the entire system in place. The AC standard can be sent to a national metrology institute to provide traceability at the highest level.

# High Power RF Calibration System Configurations

The High Power RF Calibration System can be configured differently depending on what you are calibrating. The two most popular configurations are shown below. Figure 1 shows the system set up to calibrate one of TEGAM’s standards, either the TEGAM 2601A or 2602A depending on the frequency band required. Figure 2 shows the calibration of a DUT using the 2601A or 2602A as the Standard.
