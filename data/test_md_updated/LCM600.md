LED Indicators

Two (2) provided are clearly visible up to a 45 degree offset from vertical with office environment ambient lighting. The status is reflected in the indicator color.

The DC_OK LED LED is bicolor. It shall light green if the DC output is within specification, and amber if the output falls out of specification.

The AC_OK LED LED is green if the AC is within specification and off when out of specification. Note: With 5 V standby, Amber also indicates that PSU is in standby mode/output off.

Control Signals

|AC_OK|Open collector 0.7 V maximum at 10 mA. Normally low when input AC is within specification.|
