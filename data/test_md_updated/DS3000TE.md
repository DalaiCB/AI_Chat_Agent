# ARTESYN DS3000TE 3000 Watt Front-End AC-DC Power Supply

Advanced Energy's Artesyn DS3000TE series bulk front end power AC-DC supply is designed to fully utilize the current capacity of standard C19/C20 AC inlet distribution connectors. It accepts 180–264 Vac input and provides a main 12 V output plus a 12 V standby output. Rated at 3,000 watts when operating from a 208-264 Vac input, the DS3000TE is an 80 Plus Titanium power supply with a very high conversion efficiency of more than 96% at 50% load.

Housed in a compact enclosure measuring just 4.15 x 2.78 x 11 inches, the power supply has a power density of 24 watts per cubic inch; six units can fit on a standard 19 inch rack shelf to provide a total of 18 kilowatts.
