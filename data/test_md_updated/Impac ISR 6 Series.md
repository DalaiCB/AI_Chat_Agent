# IMPAC ISR 6 ADVANCED

# OVERVIEW

The ISR 6 Advanced ratio pyrometer uses two adjacent wavelengths for the temperature determination. This technique offers the following advantages compared to standard 1-color pyrometers:

- The temperature measurement is largely independent of the object’s emissivity and in wide ranges unaffected by dust and other contaminants in the field of view.
- The measuring object can be smaller than the spot size, measurements through dirty viewing windows are possible up to a certain contamination.
- The response time of only 2 ms facilitates the measurement of fast processes. The ISR 6 is equipped with a built-in “dirty window” warning.
- The pyrometer can be connected to a PC through an RS485 to USB connection, enabling parameter adjustments to be made using the InfraWin software. This can be used for temperature indication, data logging and further analyzing of complete temperature processes.

Additionally the pyrometer can be switched to 1-color mode and used like a conventional pyrometer in a spectral range near 0.9 μm.

Optional Integrated Line Optics

Besides the standard optical heads, the ISR 6 Advanced is also available with integrated line optics, which features a special spot in the shape of a line. This provides additional advantages for some applications such as wire production or pouring stream measurements.

The orientation of the line spot is vertical for MB 14 (wire moves horizontally)

The orientation of the line spot is horizontal for MB 25 (pouring stream runs vertical) The width of the spot equals 5% of the measuring distance

# IMPAC ISR 6 ADVANCED

# INFRAWIN OVERVIEW

InfraWin is easy-to-use measurement and evaluation software for remote configuration of stationary, digital IMPAC brand pyrometers.

This software allows the user to remotely adjust and control settings for one or two pyrometers from a single computer. InfraWin also allows the user to simultaneously monitor and control temperatures.

- Display temperature data as color bars and online graphics
- Capture downstream evaluations as tables, graphics, or text files
- Calculate the spot size for different measuring distances
- Features UPP standard (Universal Pyrometer Protocol)

# Pyrometer Settings

An IMPAC digital pyrometer connected to a PC will be automatically detected by the software. All available parameters are adjustable, including emissivity, response time, maximum value storage, output signal, and sub-range.

Further special functions are adjustable, for example, controllers or TV parameters on instruments available with these functions. Changes are transmitted directly to the pyrometer.

# Measurement with Color Bar

In this window, a temperature value for the upper or lower limit can be adjusted numerically or with the mouse. The acquired minimum and maximum value is indicated as well as the inner temperature of the pyrometer. The emissivity is changeable during the measurement at any time.

# Infrared Calculator

After input of the aperture and the focused spot size per datasheet, the calculation of spot sizes at non-focused distances is possible.

|LUMASENSE|82.9°C|
|---|---|
| |104.7°C|
| |110.0°C|

Measurement with Internal Temperature of radiation temperature and internal instrument temperature. Parameters can be changed during the measurement.

I/O Module allows users to trigger measurement externally and gives a potential free output contact.
