Advanced Energy's Artesyn DS1100SDC-3 series bulk front end DC-DC power supply accepts a wide range -36 to –72 VDC input and provides a main 12 V output plus a 12 V standby output. It is rated at 1,100 watts. Housed in a 1U high rack-mounting enclosure with a short form factor that frees up system space, the DS1100SDC-3 has a very high power density of 24 watts per cubic inch. This series comes in two airflow versions – dc-connector to ac-connector and vice versa. The series is also in the same form factor and has the same output configuration as the DS1100PED-3
