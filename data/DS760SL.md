Advanced Energy's Artesyn DS760SL series bulk front end AC-DC power supply accepts a wide range 90 to 264 VAC input and provides a main 12 V output plus a 5 V standby output. Rated at 760 watts it has a high peak efficiency of 91%. Housed in a slimline 1U high, 2.1 in wide rack-mounting package, the power supply is primarily designed for ‘always-on’ enterprise servers and similar space-constrained applications. This series comes in two airflow versions – dc-connector to ac-connector and vice versa
